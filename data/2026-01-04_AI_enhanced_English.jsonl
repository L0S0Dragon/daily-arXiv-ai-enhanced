First, we define PT symmetry in three distinct contexts: non-Hermitian systems, nonlinear dynamical systems, and Markovian open quantum systems, highlighting the interconnections between these frameworks. Second, we develop mean-field theories of L-PT phase transitions for collective-spin systems and for bipartite bosonic systems with particle-number conservation. Within these classes of models, we show that L-PT symmetry can induce a breaking of continuous time-translation symmetry down to a discrete one, leading to persistent periodic dynamics. We further demonstrate that the L-PT phase transition point is typically \\textit{a critical exceptional point}, where multiple collective excitation modes with zero excitation spectrum coalesce. These findings establish an explicit connection to continuous-time crystals and non-reciprocal phase transitions. Third, going beyond the mean-field theory, we analyze statistical and quantum properties, such as purity and quantum entanglement indicators of time-independent steady states for several specific models with the L-PT symmetry. Finally, we discuss future research directions for L-PT phase transitions.", "AI": {"tldr": "Review paper on Lindbladian parity-time (L-PT) phase transitions in many-body Markovian open quantum systems, connecting them to continuous-time crystals and non-reciprocal phase transitions.", "motivation": "To review recent advances in understanding L-PT phase transitions in open quantum systems, which connect to exotic nonequilibrium phenomena like continuous-time crystals and non-reciprocal phase transitions.", "method": "1) Define PT symmetry in three contexts: non-Hermitian systems, nonlinear dynamical systems, and Markovian open quantum systems. 2) Develop mean-field theories for collective-spin systems and bipartite bosonic systems. 3) Analyze statistical and quantum properties beyond mean-field theory.", "result": "L-PT symmetry can induce breaking of continuous time-translation symmetry to discrete symmetry, leading to persistent periodic dynamics (continuous-time crystals).

We show that the Toffoli count can be reduced to at most n. The Toffoli depth can also be reduced to O(1), at the cost of 2n Toffoli gates, even without using any ancilla or measurement. In fact, using a measurement-based uncomputation, the Toffoli depth can be further reduced to 1. From this, we give two corollaries: any controlled Clifford circuit can be implemented with O(1) T-depth, and any Clifford+T circuit with T-depth D can be controlled with T-depth O(D), even without ancillas.

Although ADAPT-VQE avoids many of the shortcomings of other VQEs, it is sometimes hindered by a phenomenon known as gradient troughs. This refers to a non-monotonic convergence of the gradients, which may become very small even though the minimum energy has not been reached. This results in difficulties finding the right operators to add to the ansatz, due to the limited number of shots and statistical uncertainties, leading to stagnation in the circuit structure optimization. In this paper, we propose ways to detect and mitigate this phenomenon. Leveraging the non-commutative algebra of the ansatz, we develop heuristics for determining where to insert new operators into the circuit. We find that gradient troughs are more likely to arise when the same locations are used repeatedly for new operator insertions. Our novel protocols, which add new operators in different ansatz positions, allow us to escape gradient troughs and thereby lower the measurement cost of the algorithm. This approach achieves an effective balance between cost and efficiency, leading to faster convergence without compromising the low circuit depth and gate count of ADAPT-VQE.", "AI": {"tldr": "ADAPT-VQE suffers from gradient troughs causing convergence stagnation; proposed methods detect and mitigate troughs by strategically inserting operators at different circuit positions to reduce measurement costs and improve convergence.", "motivation": "ADAPT-VQE balances hardware efficiency, trainability, and accuracy but is hindered by gradient troughs - non-monotonic gradient convergence where gradients become small before reaching minimum energy, causing stagnation in circuit optimization due to limited shots and statistical uncertainties.", "method": "Develop heuristics leveraging non-commutative algebra of the ansatz to determine optimal insertion points for new operators; propose novel protocols that add operators at different ansatz positions rather than repeatedly using same locations to escape gradient troughs.", "result": "Gradient troughs are more likely when same insertion locations are used repeatedly; new protocols successfully escape troughs, lower measurement costs, achieve faster convergence while maintaining low circuit depth and gate count of ADAPT-VQE.", "conclusion": "Strategic operator insertion at varied circuit positions effectively mitigates gradient troughs in ADAPT-VQE, balancing cost and efficiency for improved quantum simulation of correlated systems."}}

Our framework allows any tomographic data - including archival datasets -- to be reinterpreted in terms of fundamental nonlocality tests. We introduce a generic, constructive method to generate tailored Bell inequalities and showcase their applicability to certify the non-locality of states in realistic experimental scenarios. Recognizing the stabilizer nature of the considered operators, we analyze our inequalities in the context of witnessing quantum magic - a crucial resource for quantum computing.
