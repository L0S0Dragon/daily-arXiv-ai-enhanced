### [1] [Exponential gain in clock precision using quantum correlated ticks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10785)
*Florian Meier,Yuri Minoguchi,Gianmichele Blasi,Géraldine Haack,Marcus Huber*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Quantum self-correcting clocks use quantum correlations between consecutive ticks to achieve exponential precision advantage at ultra-short timescales, overcoming limitations of traditional oscillator-based or stochastic tick approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional clock designs face fundamental precision limits at ultra-short timescales: oscillator-based clocks focus on long-term stability but lack short-term precision, while stochastic tick approaches optimize individual ticks but don't address correlations between consecutive ticks. There's a need for new paradigms that can operate at ultra-short timescales with high precision.

Method: The paper proposes autonomous self-correction of consecutive ticks through quantum correlations. It introduces a model of coupled quantum systems where the emergent Pauli exclusion principle correlates the clock at quantum level. The authors fully solve this model and demonstrate through simulations with realistic imperfections how quantum transport theory insights can be integrated into clock operation.

Result: The quantum self-correction approach yields an exponential advantage in precision at ultra-short timescales. Simulations show this remarkable gain in precision remains stable even with realistic imperfections, providing a roadmap for implementation with contemporary quantum technologies.

Conclusion: Quantum correlations between consecutive ticks enable a new paradigm for ultra-short timescale clocks with exponential precision advantages, offering a viable alternative to traditional approaches and promising practical implementation with current quantum technologies.

Abstract: Creating precise timing devices at ultra-short time scales is not just an important technological challenge, but confronts us with foundational questions about timekeeping's ultimate precision limits. Research on clocks has either focused on long-term stability using an oscillator stabilized by a level transition, limiting precision at short timescales, or on making individual stochastic ticks as precise as possible. Here, we prove the viability of a conceptually different avenue: the autonomous self-correction of consecutive ticks by quantum correlations. This provides a new paradigm that integrates the advantages and insights from quantum transport theory to operate clocks at ultra-short timescales. We fully solve a model of coupled quantum systems and show how the emergent Pauli exclusion principle correlates the clock at the quantum level yielding an exponential advantage in precision. We furthermore demonstrate through simulations with realistic imperfections that this remarkable gain in precision remains stable providing a roadmap for implementation with contemporary quantum technologies.

### [2] [Elevator Codes: Concatenation for resource-efficient quantum memory under biased noise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10786)
*Peter Shanahan,Diego Ruiz*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A new 2D local code construction using concatenated classical codes reduces qubit overhead by over 50% for highly biased noise (η ≥ 7×10⁴), outperforming rectangular surface and XZZX codes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Biased-noise qubits suppress certain error types (X/Y) relative to others (Z), reducing quantum error correction overhead. Existing codes like rectangular surface code and XZZX code have limitations: low threshold for rectangular surface code, and double physical qubit requirement for XZZX code to maintain distance.

Method: Concatenation of two classical codes: inner codes are repetition phase-flip codes, outer codes are high-rate bit-flip codes implemented at logical level to circumvent device connectivity constraints. This approach addresses phase-flip and bit-flip errors at different coding layers.

Result: The construction reduces qubit overhead by over 50% at p_Z=10⁻³ and η=2×10⁶ to achieve logical error rate of 10⁻¹², outperforming previous codes for noise biases η ≥ 7×10⁴. High-rate outer codes keep overhead for correcting residual bit-flip errors comparable to repetition code itself.

Conclusion: Under sufficiently biased noise, it's advantageous to address phase-flip and bit-flip errors at different coding layers: inner code should prioritize high threshold for phase-flip errors, while outer code should optimize encoding rate efficiency. This approach meaningfully reduces overhead compared to earlier methods.

Abstract: Biased-noise qubits, in which one type of error (e.g. $X$- and $Y$-type errors) is significantly suppressed relative to the other (e.g. $Z$-type errors), can significantly reduce the overhead of quantum error correction. Codes such as the rectangular surface code or XZZX code substantially reduce the qubit overhead under biased noise, but they still face challenges. The rectangular surface code suffers from a relatively low threshold, while the XZZX code requires twice as many physical qubits to maintain the same code distance as the surface code. In this work, we introduce a 2D local code construction that outperforms these codes for noise biases $η\ge 7\times10^{4}$, reducing the qubit overhead by over 50% at $p_Z=10^{-3}$ and $η= 2 \times 10^6$ to achieve a logical error rate of $10^{-12}$. Our construction relies on the concatenation of two classical codes. The inner codes are repetition phase-flip codes while the outer codes are high-rate bit-flip codes enabled by their implementation at the logical level, which circumvents device connectivity constraints. These results indicate that under sufficiently biased noise, it is advantageous to address phase-flip and bit-flip errors at different layers of the coding scheme. The inner code should prioritize a high threshold for phase-flip errors, while the bit-flip outer code should optimize for encoding rate efficiency. In the strong biased-noise regime, high-rate outer codes keep the overhead for correcting residual bit-flip errors comparable to that of the repetition code itself, meaningfully lower than that required by earlier approaches.

### [3] [Critical non-equilibrium phases from noisy topological memories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10792)
*Amir-Reza Negari,Subhayan Sahu,Jan Behrends,Benjamin Béri,Timothy H. Hsieh*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Extended non-equilibrium critical phase with sub-exponential CMI decay in surface code under heralded Pauli measurements, mapped to loop model Goldstone phase, with polylogarithmic CMI decay and partial logical information recoverable only globally.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the nature of quantum information preservation in non-equilibrium quantum error-correcting codes, specifically how heralded measurements affect the surface code's ability to retain logical information and what types of decoders can recover it.

Method: Map the surface code under heralded random Pauli measurement channels to a completely packed loop model on a square lattice, analyze the resulting Goldstone phase, derive conditional mutual information (CMI) behavior from loop length scales, and introduce punctured coherent information as a diagnostic for quasi-local decodability.

Result: Discovery of an extended critical phase with polylogarithmic decay of CMI, where partial logical information persists but can only be recovered by global decoders, not by any quasi-local decoder, as demonstrated by the punctured coherent information diagnostic.

Conclusion: Heralded measurements in the surface code create a non-equilibrium critical phase that preserves quantum information in a fundamentally non-local way, requiring global decoding strategies rather than local or quasi-local approaches for recovery.

Abstract: We demonstrate the existence of an extended non-equilibrium critical phase, characterized by sub-exponential decay of conditional mutual information (CMI), in the surface code subject to heralded random Pauli measurement channels. By mapping the resulting mixed state to the ensemble of completely packed loops on a square lattice, we relate the extended phase to the Goldstone phase of the loop model. In particular, CMI is controlled by the characteristic length scale of loops, and we use analytic results of the latter to establish polylogarithmic decay of CMI in the critical phase. We find that the critical phase retains partial logical information that can be recovered by a global decoder, but not by any quasi-local decoder. To demonstrate this, we introduce a diagnostic called punctured coherent information which provides a necessary condition for quasi-local decoding.

### [4] [Parent Hamiltonians for stabilizer quantum many-body scars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10805)
*Shane Dooley*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A systematic method to embed stabilizer states as quantum many-body scars in local Hamiltonians using factorizable Pauli strings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a general framework for constructing quantum many-body scars from stabilizer states, unifying existing results and enabling creation of new scar states with complex entanglement structures.

Method: Uses factorizability of Pauli strings on lattices to convert stabilizer elements into local, few-body operators that annihilate stabilizer states, systematically constructing parent Hamiltonians with zero-energy stabilizer QMBS near mid-spectrum.

Result: The method reproduces known QMBS examples (rainbow scars, entangled antipodal Bell pairs) and constructs new stabilizer QMBS with complex entanglement (cluster state, toric code state, antipodal toric code state). Exact diagonalization confirms these as exact eigenstates.

Conclusion: Provides a unified framework for constructing quantum many-body scars from stabilizer states, enabling systematic exploration of scarred Hamiltonians with various entanglement structures beyond previously known examples.

Abstract: Quantum many-body scars (QMBS) have attracted considerable interest due to their role in weak ergodicity breaking in many-body systems. We present a general construction that embeds stabilizer states as QMBS of local Hamiltonians. The method relies on a notion of factorizability of Pauli strings on a lattice, which is used to convert stabilizer elements into local, few-body operators that annihilate the stabilizer state. This enables the systematic construction of parent Hamiltonians with zero-energy stabilizer QMBS typically near the middle of the spectrum. The method reproduces several known results in a unified framework, including recent examples of volume-law entangled QMBS, such as the ``rainbow'' QMBS and the entangled antipodal Bell pair state. We also apply the framework to construct examples of stabilizer QMBS with a more complex entanglement structure, such as the cluster state, the toric code state, and a volume-law entangled state we dub the antipodal toric code (ATC) state. Exact diagonalization confirms our results and reveal the stabilizer states as exact eigenstates of their parent Hamiltonian.

### [5] [Charging a quantum battery from the Bloch sphere](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10844)
*C. A. Downing,M. S. Ukhtary*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Analytical study of quantum battery charging using two qubits (charger+battery) with generalized initial states, revealing dependencies on quantum coherences, population inversions, and deviations from standard thermodynamic results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a comprehensive quantum thermodynamic framework for quantum battery charging that accounts for arbitrary initial quantum states of the charger, moving beyond simplified assumptions to understand how quantum coherences and population inversions affect energy storage and extraction.

Method: Analytical modeling of a two-qubit quantum battery system (charger qubit + battery cell qubit) with the charger's initial state parameterized by Bloch sphere coordinates. Derivation of generalized expressions for stored energy, ergotropy, and capacity using quantum thermodynamics formalism.

Result: Found that stored energy, ergotropy, and capacity depend on the initial Bloch polar angle in a pattern reminiscent of the quantum area theorem. Identified that ergotropy originates from quantum coherences and population inversions, with their relative contributions determined by the starting polar angle. Discovered significant deviations in ergotropic charging power and optimal charging time from standard thermodynamic results.

Conclusion: The study provides fundamental theoretical groundwork for quantum battery systems, demonstrating the crucial role of quantum state preparation in energy storage performance. The findings offer guidance for experimental implementations using coupled two-level systems in quantum energy science.

Abstract: We reconsider the quantum energetics and quantum thermodynamics of the charging process of a simple, two-component quantum battery model made up of a charger qubit and a single--cell battery qubit. We allow for the initial quantum state of the charger to lie anywhere on the surface of the Bloch sphere, and find the generalized analytical expressions describing the stored energy, ergotropy and capacity of the battery, all of which depend upon the initial Bloch sphere polar angle in a manner evocative of the quantum area theorem. The origin of the ergotropy produced, as well as the genesis of the battery capacity, can be readily traced back to the quantum coherences and population inversions generated (and the balance between these two mechanisms is contingent upon the starting Bloch polar angle). Importantly, the ergotropic charging power and its associated optimal charging time display notable deviations from standard results which disregard thermodynamic considerations. Our theoretical groundwork may be useful for guiding forthcoming experiments in quantum energy science based upon coupled two-level systems.

### [6] [Efficient Quantum Circuits for the Hilbert Transform](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10876)
*Henry Zhang,Joseph Li*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Quantum algorithm for discrete Hilbert transform with polylogarithmic size and logarithmic depth, exponentially faster than classical methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Hilbert transform is powerful for non-stationary signals and anomaly detection, but no efficient quantum implementations existed despite quantum Fourier and wavelet transforms being well-established in quantum information processing.

Method: Novel construction of quantum Hilbert transform with polylogarithmic size and logarithmic depth for signals of length N, generalized to d-dimensional Hilbert transform with depth O(d log N).

Result: Exponentially fewer operations than classical algorithms for the same mapping; simulations demonstrate effectiveness for power systems control and image processing with exact agreement with classical results.

Conclusion: First efficient quantum implementation of discrete Hilbert transform, providing exponential speedup over classical methods and enabling new quantum signal processing applications.

Abstract: The quantum Fourier transform and quantum wavelet transform have been cornerstones of quantum information processing. However, for non-stationary signals and anomaly detection, the Hilbert transform can be a more powerful tool, yet no prior work has provided efficient quantum implementations for the discrete Hilbert transform. This letter presents a novel construction for a quantum Hilbert transform in polylogarithmic size and logarithmic depth for a signal of length $N$, exponentially fewer operations than classical algorithms for the same mapping. We generalize this algorithm to create any $d$-dimensional Hilbert transform in depth $O(d\log N)$. Simulations demonstrate effectiveness for tasks such as power systems control and image processing, with exact agreement with classical results.

### [7] [Two-tooth bosonic quantum comb for temporal-correlation sensing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10916)
*Shaojiang Zhu,Xinyuan You,Alexander Romanenko,Anna Grassellino*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A two-tooth bosonic quantum comb enables multi-time coherence transport analysis between thermal absorber and coherent probe, allowing bosonic noise spectroscopy that distinguishes Markovian temperature noise from structured fluctuations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a method for probing fluctuating bosonic environments that can capture both instantaneous fluctuations and their temporal correlations, enabling discrimination between different types of noise in quantum systems.

Method: Introduces a two-tooth bosonic quantum comb with sequential interactions between thermal absorber and long-lived coherent probe, using process-tensor formulation to derive closed-form expressions for coherence transport and interference effects between interaction windows.

Result: The probe records both instantaneous fluctuations and temporal correlations, with interference generating non-monotonic memory response reflecting competition between thermal population and dynamical correlations; sweeping temporal separation enables direct sampling of absorber's population correlator for bosonic noise spectroscopy.

Conclusion: The approach provides a general method for probing fluctuating bosonic environments, compatible with circuit-QED platforms, enabling discrimination between Markovian temperature noise and slow/spectrally structured fluctuations through bosonic noise spectroscopy.

Abstract: We introduce a two-tooth bosonic quantum comb that captures the sequential interactions between a thermal absorber and a long-lived coherent probe. The comb provides a causal, multi-time description of coherence transport, tracking how the probe records both instantaneous fluctuations and their temporal correlations. Using a process-tensor formulation, we derive closed form expressions showing that interference between the two interaction windows generates a non-monotonic memory response that reflects a fundamental competition between the absorbers thermal population and its dynamical correlations. By sweeping the temporal separation between the interaction windows, the probe directly samples the absorbers population correlator, enabling bosonic noise spectroscopy that discriminates Markovian temperature noise from slow or spectrally structured fluctuations. The approach is readily compatible with circuit-QED platforms and offers a general method for probing fluctuating bosonic environments.

### [8] [Quantum trajectories for time-binned data and their closeness to fully conditioned quantum trajectories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10937)
*Nattaphong Wonglakhon,Areeya Chantasri,Howard M. Wiseman*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper analyzes finite-interval dynamical maps for quantum trajectories conditioned on binned measurement data, showing that while binned data yields nearly pure states with O(Δt³) impurity, the distance from true conditioned states scales as O(Δt³/²). A new Φ-map using one additional statistic achieves O(Δt²) accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is renewed interest in dynamical maps for quantum trajectories with finite time intervals, particularly for experimentally relevant cases where only average current over each interval is available. Understanding the accuracy of such binned-data approaches is crucial for practical quantum measurement scenarios.

Method: The authors analyze dynamical maps for quantum trajectories conditioned on binned measurement data. They compare: 1) the binned-data map using only average current It, 2) a new Φ-map requiring one additional real statistic φt of the current, 3) the lowest-order (Itô) map, and 4) two other higher-order maps. They derive scaling laws for impurity and distance from true conditioned states, and numerically verify these scalings.

Result: The binned-data map yields conditioned states with impurity scaling as O(Δt³) but typical distance from true conditioned states scales as O(Δt³/²). The new Φ-map, requiring only one additional statistic φt, achieves distance scaling as O(Δt²) from the true conditioned states. Numerical verification confirms these scalings across different maps.

Conclusion: For generic systems, if the additional statistic φt can be extracted experimentally along with average current It, the Φ-map provides superior accuracy (O(Δt²)) compared to other finite-interval dynamical maps, making it the optimal choice for quantum trajectory reconstruction from binned measurement data.

Abstract: Quantum trajectories are dynamical equations for quantum states conditioned on the results of a time-continuous measurement, such as a continuous-in-time current $\vec y_t$. Recently there has been renewed interest in dynamical maps for quantum trajectories with time-intervals of finite size $Δt$. Guilmin \emph{et al.} (unpublished) derived such a dynamical map for the (experimentally relevant) case where only the average current $I_t$ over each interval is available. Surprisingly, this binned data still generates a conditioned state $ρ_\text{\faFaucet}$ that is almost pure (for efficient measurements), with an impurity scaling as $(Δt)^{3}$. We show that, nevertheless, the typical distance of $ρ_\text{\faFaucet}$ from $\hatψ_{\text{F}; \vec y_t}$ -- the projector for the pure state conditioned on the full current -- is as large as $(Δt)^{3/2}$. We introduce another finite-interval dynamical map (``$Φ$-map''), which requires only one additional real statistic, $φ_t$, of the current in the interval, that gives a conditioned state $\hatψ_Φ$ which is only $(Δt)^{2}$-distant from $\hatψ_{\text{F}; \vec y_t}$. We numerically verify these scalings of the error (distance from the true states) for these two maps, as well as for the lowest-order (Itô) map and two other higher-order maps. Our results show that, for a generic system, if the statistic $φ_t$ can be extracted from experiment along with $I_t$, then the $Φ$-map gives a smaller error than any other.

### [9] [The Hilbert-Schmidt norms of quantum channels and matrix integrals over the unit sphere](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10943)
*Yuan Li,Zhengli Chen,Zhihua Guo,Yongfeng Pang*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Analysis of quantum channel norms and their complementary channels, with focus on extremal values of the sum of squared Hilbert-Schmidt norms, plus results on pure state preservation and matrix integrals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To characterize the range of possible values for the sum of squared Hilbert-Schmidt norms of quantum channels and their complementary channels, and to identify channels achieving extremal values. Additional motivation includes understanding completely positive maps preserving pure states in infinite dimensions and exploring equivalencies of matrix integrals over the unit sphere.

Method: Mathematical analysis of quantum channels using Hilbert-Schmidt norms and complementary channel theory. Study of completely positive maps on infinite dimensional systems with pure state preservation properties. Demonstration of equivalencies between various matrix integrals over the unit sphere through mathematical proofs.

Result: Determined the range of possible values for ‖ℰ‖₂² + ‖ℰ̃‖₂² for quantum channels ℰ and their complementary channels ℰ̃. Provided equivalent characterizations for channels achieving maximum and minimum values. Obtained concrete description of completely positive maps on infinite dimensional systems that preserve pure states. Demonstrated equivalency of several matrix integrals over the unit sphere and obtained extensions of these integrals.

Conclusion: The paper establishes fundamental bounds on the sum of squared Hilbert-Schmidt norms of quantum channels and their complementary channels, providing complete characterization of extremal channels. It contributes to understanding quantum channel properties, pure state preservation in infinite dimensions, and mathematical properties of matrix integrals relevant to quantum information theory.

Abstract: The dynamics of quantum systems are generally described by a family of quantum channels (linear, completely positive and trace preserving maps). In this note, we mainly study the range of all possible values of $\|\mathcal{E}\|_2^2+\|\widetilde{\mathcal{E}}\|_2^2$ for quantum channels $\mathcal{E}$ and give the equivalent characterizations for quantum channels that achieve these maximum and minimum values, respectively, where $\|\mathcal{E}\|_2$ is the Hilbert-Schmidt norm of $\mathcal{E}$ and $\widetilde{\mathcal{E}}$ is a complementary channel of $\mathcal{E}.$ Also, we get a concrete description of completely positive maps on infinite dimensional systems preserving pure states. Moreover, the equivalency of several matrix integrals over the unit sphere is demonstrated and some extensions of these matrix integrals are obtained.

### [10] [The two-time Leggett-Garg inequalities of a superconducting qubit interacting with thermal photons in a cavity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10946)
*Hiroo Azuma*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Study of Leggett-Garg inequality violations in a Josephson-junction qubit interacting with magnetic flux, showing temperature-dependent power-law decay of quantum coherence signatures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate quantum coherence and macroscopic realism in a non-exactly-solvable quantum optical model involving a Josephson-junction qubit interacting with photons, extending previous exactly-solvable models to understand temperature effects on Leggett-Garg inequality violations.

Method: Analyze a quantum optical model where a qubit interacts with photons via a squared linear combination of annihilation/creation operators (unlike previous exactly-solvable models). Use second-order perturbation theory to approximate time evolution since the model is not exactly solvable. Perform numerical calculations to study Leggett-Garg inequality violations as functions of temperature and coupling constant.

Result: Leggett-Garg inequality violation diminishes with increasing temperature following power-law behavior. The power-law exponents depend on the qubit-photon coupling constant. Larger coupling constants lead to reduced violation and decreased temperature sensitivity of the violation.

Conclusion: Temperature strongly affects quantum coherence signatures in Josephson-junction systems, with Leggett-Garg violations showing coupling-dependent power-law decay. This provides insights into how environmental interactions and temperature influence macroscopic quantum phenomena in superconducting qubit systems.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the two-time Leggett-Garg (LG) inequalities of a quantum optical model that appears in the Josephson-junction quantum bit (qubit) interacting with an external magnetic flux. This model is a natural extension of an exactly solvable model whose interaction between a qubit and single-mode photons is given by a product of the Pauli $z$ operator of the qubit and a linear combination of annihilation and creation operators of the photons. By contrast, a photon's part of the interaction of our model is given by the square of the linear combination. Because our model is not solvable, we approximately investigate its time evolution up to the second-order perturbation. Our numerical calculations show that violation of the LG inequality diminishes as the temperature increases. Moreover, it exhibits power laws of the temperature, whose exponents vary depending on the coupling constant of the interaction between the qubit and photons. The violation of the LG inequality decreases and becomes less sensitive to the temperature as the coupling constant of the interaction gets larger.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine the minimum communication required between Alice and Bob to faithfully simulate their respective partial measurement results when a central server performs quantum measurements, given they share common randomness.

Method: Analyzes communication complexity in a scenario where Charlie measures quantum system C with POVM {Λ_x}, Alice and Bob are interested in partial results g_A(x) and g_B(x) respectively, and all parties share common randomness.

Result: Develops achievable regions for the amount of communication needed between Alice and Bob to simulate their measurement outcomes faithfully.

Conclusion: Establishes bounds on communication requirements for distributed quantum measurement simulation with shared randomness, providing achievable rate regions for this communication complexity problem.

Abstract: In this paper a central server Charlie has access to a quantum system C and measures it with a POVM $\{Λ_x\}$. Alice and Bob are only interested in the partial results $g_A(x)$ respectively $g_B(x)$. Alice, Bob, and Charlie share common randomness and Alice and Bob only need to faithfully simulate their measurements. The paper develops to achievable regions for the amount of communication needed to Alice and Bob.

### [12] [Stabilizer Code-Generic Universal Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10964)
*Nicholas J. C. Papadopoulos,Ramin Ayanzadeh*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Novel ancilla-mediated protocols enable universal fault-tolerant quantum computation with any stabilizer code, eliminating need for code concatenation, switching, or magic state distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing error-correcting codes alone cannot achieve universal quantum computation; traditional techniques like code concatenation, code switching, or magic state distillation are costly and code-specific.

Method: Implements logical Clifford and T gates through novel ancilla-mediated protocols using helper codes in ancilla registers and mid-circuit measurements without modifying underlying data codes.

Result: Creates universal fault-tolerant quantum gate set that is deterministic, doesn't consume ancilla registers, works generically over all stabilizer codes, and enables communication between heterogeneous codes.

Conclusion: Any single stabilizer code becomes capable of universal quantum computation, opening possibilities for existing and undiscovered codes and their scalable, heterogeneous coexistence.

Abstract: Fault-tolerant quantum computation allows quantum computations to be carried out while resisting unwanted noise. Several error correcting codes have been developed to achieve this task, but none alone are capable of universal quantum computation. This universality is highly desired and often achieved using additional techniques such as code concatenation, code switching, or magic state distillation, which can be costly and only work for specific codes. This work implements logical Clifford and T gates through novel ancilla-mediated protocols to construct a universal fault-tolerant quantum gate set. Unlike traditional techniques, our implementation is deterministic, does not consume ancilla registers, does not modify the underlying data codes or registers, and is generic over all stabilizer codes. Thus, any single code becomes capable of universal quantum computation by leveraging helper codes in ancilla registers and mid-circuit measurements. Furthermore, since these logical gates are stabilizer code-generic, these implementations enable communication between heterogeneous stabilizer codes. These features collectively open the door to countless possibilities for existing and undiscovered codes as well as their scalable, heterogeneous coexistence.

*Chenlu Li,Hui Zeng,Dazhi Ding*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: NA-QAS is a noise-aware quantum architecture search framework that identifies robust quantum circuit designs under noisy conditions using variational quantum circuits, hybrid Hamiltonian ε-greedy optimization, and enhanced NSGA-II algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum architecture search (QAS) automates quantum circuit design for specific tasks and hardware constraints, but existing approaches lack explicit noise consideration. The need for noise-robust quantum architectures that maintain performance under realistic noisy quantum hardware conditions motivates this work.

Method: Proposes a noise-aware QAS framework based on variational quantum circuit design: 1) Incorporates noise models into parameterized quantum circuit (PQC) training to identify noise-robust architectures, 2) Uses hybrid Hamiltonian ε-greedy strategy to optimize evaluation costs and avoid local optima, 3) Employs enhanced variable-depth NSGA-II algorithm to navigate search space and balance architectural expressibility with hardware overhead.

Result: Validated through binary classification and iris multi-classification tasks under noisy conditions. The framework successfully searches for quantum architectures with superior performance and greater resource efficiency compared to existing approaches under noisy conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed NA-QAS framework effectively automates the design of noise-robust quantum circuits, demonstrating improved performance and resource efficiency for quantum machine learning tasks under realistic noisy quantum hardware conditions.

Abstract: Quantum architecture search (QAS) has emerged to automate the design of high-performance quantum circuits under specific tasks and hardware constraints. We propose a noise-aware quantum architecture search (NA-QAS) framework based on variational quantum circuit design. By incorporating a noise model into the training of parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) , the proposed framework identifies the noise-robust architectures. We introduce a hybrid Hamiltonian $\varepsilon$ -greedy strategy to optimize evaluation costs and circumvent local optima. Furthermore, an enhanced variable-depth NSGA-II algorithm is employed to navigate the vast search space, enabling an automated trade-off between architectural expressibility and quantum hardware overhead. The effectiveness of the framework is validated through binary classification and iris multi-classification tasks under a noisy condition. Compared to existing approaches, our framework can search for quantum architectures with superior performance and greater resource efficiency under a noisy condition.

*Si-Min Wang,Ming-Liang Hu,Heng Fan*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Off-resonant interactions preserve and generate quantum imaginarity resources (NAQI and DIA) in distributed two-qubit systems interacting with lossy cavities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how imaginarity (treated as a quantum resource) can be preserved and generated in distributed quantum systems, particularly focusing on the role of off-resonant interactions in maintaining these resources against decoherence.

Method: Study nonlocal advantage of quantum imaginarity (NAQI) and distillable imaginarity of assistance (DIA) in a system of two qubits interacting with a lossy cavity. Analyze scenarios with symmetric detuning between qubits and cavity, and examine initial product states with equal detunings but unequal couplings.

Result: Both NAQI and DIA can be well preserved for long times with large symmetric detuning. Off-resonant interactions generate high degrees of NAQI and DIA from initial product states. The physical mechanism is explained through effective qubit-qubit coupling mediated by the cavity mode.

Conclusion: Off-resonant interactions play a crucial role in efficient control of imaginarity resources in distributed quantum scenarios, providing a strategy to preserve and generate these resources against environmental losses.

Abstract: We study the nonlocal advantage of quantum imaginarity (NAQI) and distillable imaginarity of assistance (DIA), which treat imaginarity as a resource in distributed scenarios. For two qubits interacting with a lossy cavity, it is shown that both the NAQI and DIA can be well preserved for long times in the presence of large and symmetric detuning between the qubits and the cavity. Moreover, the off-resonant interaction generates a high degree of NAQI and DIA from the initial product states of two qubits having the same detunings and unequal couplings to the cavity. Based on the effective coupling of the qubits induced by the cavity mode, we explain the physical mechanism underlying the validity of this strategy. Our findings shed light on the role that off-resonant interactions have in the efficient control of imaginarity in distributed scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a scalable approach for certifying high-dimensional entanglement (Schmidt number) in n-qubit systems, overcoming the exponential scaling of worst-case sample complexity.

Method: Uses Pauli-measurement-based algorithm with local pseudorandom unitaries to transform worst-case scenarios into average-case with high probability, enabling random Pauli sampling.

Conclusion: The work provides a scalable framework for high-dimensional entanglement certification and introduces proof techniques for random Pauli sampling.

Abstract: We introduce a Pauli-measurement-based algorithm to certify the Schmidt number of $n$-qubit pure states. Our protocol achieves an average-case sample complexity of $\caO(\mathrm{poly}(n)χ^2)$, a substantial improvement over the $\caO(2^n χ)$ worst-case bound. By utilizing local pseudorandom unitaries, we ensure the worst case can be transformed into the average-case with high probability.

*Chenlu Liu,Yulong Li,Jiahui Wang,Quan Guan,Lijing Jin,Lu Ma,Ruizi Hu,Tenghui Wang,Xing Zhu,Hai-Feng Yu,Chunqing Deng,Xizheng Ma*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Single fluxonium qubit at zero flux achieves erasure conversion in 0-2 subspace using engineered resonator for mid-circuit detection and measurement, increasing logical lifetime 4.5× with negligible error per erasure check.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dual-rail encoded erasure qubits in superconducting systems require increased hardware overhead and circuit complexity. The paper aims to address these limitations by realizing erasure conversion in a simpler, single-fluxonium architecture.

Method: Uses a single fluxonium qubit operated at zero flux, encoding logical states in the 0-2 subspace. A single engineered resonator provides both mid-circuit erasure detection and end-of-line logical measurement. Post-selection on non-erasure outcomes is employed for error mitigation.

Result: Post-selection increased logical lifetime from 193 μs to 869 μs (4.5× improvement). Each erasure check contributes negligible error of 7.2×10^-5. Measurement-induced logical dephasing was characterized as function of measurement power and frequency.

Conclusion: Integer-fluxonium at zero flux provides a resource-efficient platform for erasure-based error mitigation without requiring additional hardware, making it promising for fault-tolerant quantum computing.

Abstract: Qubits that experience predominantly erasure errors offer distinct advantages for fault-tolerant operation. Indeed, dual-rail encoded erasure qubits in superconducting cavities and transmons have demonstrated high-fidelity operations by converting physical-qubit relaxation into logical-qubit erasures, but this comes at the cost of increased hardware overhead and circuit complexity. Here, we address these limitations by realizing erasure conversion in a single fluxonium operated at zero flux, where the logical state is encoded in its 0-2 subspace. A single, carefully engineered resonator provides both mid-circuit erasure detection and end-of-line (EOL) logical measurement. Post-selection on non-erasure outcomes results in more than four-fold increase of the logical lifetime, from $193~μ$s to $869~μ$s. Finally, we characterize measurement-induced logical dephasing as a function of measurement power and frequency, and infer that each erasure check contributes a negligible error of $7.2\times 10^{-5}$. These results establish integer-fluxonium as a promising, resource-efficient platform for erasure-based error mitigation, without requiring additional hardware.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: AI-assisted quantum key distribution using orbital angular momentum on UAVs with turbulence modeling and physics-informed learning for improved secret key rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable secure quantum communication on mobile UAV platforms by addressing challenges of atmospheric turbulence, pointing errors, and non-stationary flight conditions that degrade quantum key distribution performance.

Method: Developed a theoretical framework combining: 1) Unified channel model for Kolmogorov turbulence, pointing misalignment, and aperture clipping; 2) Weak plus vacuum decoy state formulation with composable finite key bounds; 3) Lightweight physics-informed learning module that combines physical priors with measured link statistics for pulse classification, data rejection, and decoding strategy recommendation.

Result: Simulations show the AI-assisted method improves secret key rate by 10-30% under moderate turbulence and milliradian-level pointing jitter while preserving composable security.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enables practical quantum key distribution on UAV platforms by integrating physical modeling with machine learning to stabilize performance under challenging atmospheric and operational conditions.

Abstract: We present a theoretical framework for quantum key distribution (QKD) using orbital angular momentum (OAM) encoded BB84 on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) platform. A unified channel model captures Kolmogorov turbulence, pointing induced misalignment, and finite aperture clipping, enabling quantitative predictions of inter mode crosstalk and the resulting quantum bit error rate (QBER). Using a weak plus vacuum decoy state formulation, we derive composable finite key lower bounds on the secret key rate that incorporate statistical fluctuations, detector dark counts, efficiency mismatch, and error correction leakage. To stabilize performance under non stationary flight conditions, we introduce a lightweight physics informed learning module that combines physical priors with measured link statistics to classify valid pulses, reject corrupted data, and recommend decoding strategies. We outline a complete evaluation pipeline including UAV system architecture, turbulence driven QBER maps, decoy optimization, finite key scaling, and AI calibration metrics. Simulations indicate that under moderate turbulence and milliradian level pointing jitter, the proposed AI assisted method can improve the secret key rate by 10 percent to 30 percent while preserving composable security.

TL;DR: Three-body bound states in continuum (BIC) formation studied via complex energy pole trajectories in 1D system with two bosons and distinguishable particle; parametric nature confirmed and extended to broader parameter space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate formation mechanisms of three-body bound states in continuum (BIC) and understand how system parameters (interaction strength, range, mass ratio) affect BIC formation, extending characterization beyond previous limited parameter studies.

Method: Used one-dimensional model with two identical bosons and one distinguishable particle interacting via Gaussian potentials. Systematically traced pole trajectories in complex energy plane while varying interaction strength, interaction range, and mass ratio.

Result: Confirmed parametric nature of few-body BIC and extended characterization to broader parameter set. Found that variations in interaction parameters and mass ratio can lead to formation of at least one three-body BIC. Mass ratio variation shows more regular pattern with multiple BIC locations compared to interaction parameter variations.

Conclusion: Few-body BIC formation mechanism is more sensitive to kinematic structure (mass ratio) than to specific details of two-body interaction, suggesting fundamental role of system kinematics in BIC emergence.

Abstract: We investigate the formation of three-body bound states in the continuum by tracing pole trajectories in the complex energy plane under variation of system parameters. Using a one-dimensional model of two identical bosons and a distinguishable particle interacting via Gaussian potentials, we systematically vary the interaction strength, interaction range, and mass ratio. Our results confirm the parametric nature of few-body bound states in a continuum (BIC) and extend this characterization to a broader set of system parameters. Specifically, we find that variations of both interaction parameters and the mass ratio can lead to the formation of at least one three-body BIC. However, the exact shape of trajectories differs, and for the mass ratio variation we find a more regular pattern with multiple BIC locations. These results suggest that the mechanism of few-body BIC formation is more sensitive to the kinematic structure of the problem than to the specific details of the two-body interaction.

TL;DR: Circular-modulated concatenated continuous driving (CM-CCD) improves qubit gate fidelity by simultaneously modulating amplitude and phase to create circular polarization, eliminating systematic pulse-area errors from imperfect rotating wave approximation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address systematic pulse-area errors in fast quantum gates caused by imperfect rotating wave approximation in conventional concatenated continuous driving (CCD) schemes, and to improve robustness against qubit frequency variations, Rabi drive coupling variations, and low-frequency noise in qubit arrays.

Method: Proposes a new variant of concatenated continuous driving (CCD) that simultaneously modulates both amplitude and phase of the driving field to generate a circularly-polarized field in the rotating frame. This circular-modulated (CM)-CCD cancels the counter-rotating term in the second rotating frame, eliminating systematic pulse-area errors. Implemented and compared different CCD protocols using an electron spin-qubit in an isotopically purified ²⁸Si-MOS quantum dot.

Result: Numerical simulations show CM-CCD achieves higher gate fidelity than conventional CCD schemes. Experimental implementation demonstrates significantly improved robustness compared to standard Rabi-drive against static detuning and Rabi frequency errors, showing effectiveness for qubit arrays with variations in qubit frequency, coupling to Rabi drive, and low-frequency noise.

Conclusion: CM-CCD provides a superior approach to noise suppression and gate fidelity improvement by eliminating systematic pulse-area errors through circular modulation. The scheme is broadly applicable to various physical systems including trapped atoms, cold atoms, superconducting qubits, and NV-centers.

Abstract: The rate of coherence loss is lower for a qubit under Rabi drive compared to a freely evolving qubit, $T_{2}^{\rm{Rabi}}>T_{2}^*$.
  Building on this principle, concatenated continuous driving (CCD) keeps the qubit under continuous drive to suppress noise and manipulate dressed states by either phase or amplitude modulation.
  In this work, we propose a new variant of CCD which simultaneously modulates both the amplitude and phase of the driving field to generate a circularly-polarized field in the rotating frame of the carrier frequency.
  This circular-modulated (CM)-CCD cancels the counter-rotating term in the second rotating frame, eliminating a systematic pulse-area error that arises from an imperfect rotating wave approximation for fast gates.
  Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed CMCCD achieves higher gate fidelity than conventional CCD schemes.
  We further implement and compare different CCD protocols using an electron spin-qubit in an isotopically purified $^{28}$Si-MOS quantum dot and evaluate its robustness by applying static detuning and Rabi frequency errors.
  The robustness is significantly improved compared to standard Rabi-drive, showing the effectiveness of this scheme for qubit arrays with variation in qubit frequency, coupling to Rabi drive, and low frequency noise.
  The proposed scheme can be applied to various physical systems, including trapped atoms, cold atoms, superconducting qubits, and NV-centers.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish connections between shortcuts to adiabaticity (STA) in quantum systems and scattering theory concepts, providing a unified framework for understanding STA protocols and their completions across quantum mechanics and quantum field theory.

Method: Exploits analogy between 1D quantum mechanics and QFT, using correspondence between Bogoliubov coefficients in quantum harmonic oscillators and transmission/reflection amplitudes in scattering theory. Analyzes STA protocols through scattering theory framework and connects particle creation to squeezed states.

Result: STA protocols for quantum harmonic oscillators with time-dependent frequency are equivalent to transmission resonances in scattering theory. STA in QFT with homogeneous backgrounds correspond to reflectionless potentials. STA completions can be understood in terms of anti-squeezing operators via the connection between particle creation and squeezed states.

Conclusion: The paper establishes a unified scattering theory framework for understanding shortcuts to adiabaticity across quantum systems, revealing fundamental connections between STA protocols, scattering phenomena, and squeezed state transformations.

Abstract: We analyze shortcuts to adiabaticity (STA) and their completions for the quantum harmonic oscillator (QHO) with time-dependent frequency, as well as for quantum field theory (QFT) in non-stationary backgrounds. We exploit the analogy with one-dimensional quantum mechanics, and the well known correspondence between Bogoliubov coefficients in the QHO and transmission/reflection amplitudes in scattering theory. Within this framework, STA protocols for the QHO are equivalent to transmission resonances, while STA in QFT with homogeneous backgrounds correspond to reflectionless potentials. Moreover, using the connection between particle creation and squeezed states, we show how STA completions can be understood in terms of the anti-squeezing operator.

TL;DR: Demonstration of a harmonic parity qubit (HPQ) that combines two aluminum-oxide tunnel junctions with a gate-tunable InAs/Al nanowire junction to control the parity of Cooper pair tunneling, enabling even-dominated Josephson harmonics and supercurrent carried by pairs of Cooper pairs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Superconducting circuits need control over harmonic parity (odd vs even Cooper pair tunneling) for various applications, but accessing even-dominated regimes has been challenging and required complex architectures.

Method: Created a harmonic parity qubit (HPQ) combining two aluminum-oxide tunnel junctions in parallel with a gate-tunable InAs/Al nanowire junction in a SQUID configuration. Used spectroscopy versus flux to reconstruct the energy-phase relation at 85 gate voltage points.

Result: At half flux quantum, odd harmonics suppressed by up to two orders of magnitude relative to even harmonics, producing a double-well potential dominated by even harmonics with minima near ±π/2. Enabled supercurrent carried by pairs of Cooper pairs.

Conclusion: The HPQ provides a simple way to control harmonic parity, enabling even-dominated Josephson regimes and serving as a new building block for Fourier engineering in superconducting circuits.

Abstract: Superconducting quantum circuits derive their nonlinearity from the Josephson energy-phase relation. Besides the fundamental $\cosφ$ term, this relation can also contain higher Fourier harmonics $\cos(kφ)$ corresponding to correlated tunneling of $k$ Cooper pairs. The parity of the dominant tunneling process, i.e.~whether an odd or even number of Cooper pairs tunnel, results in qualitatively different properties, and controlling this opens up a wide range of applications in superconducting technology. However, access to even-dominated regimes has remained challenging and has so far relied on complex multi-junction or all-hybrid architectures. Here, we demonstrate a simple "harmonic parity qubit" (HPQ); an element that combines two aluminum-oxide tunnel junctions in parallel to a gate-tunable InAs/Al nanowire junction forming a SQUID, and use spectroscopy versus flux to reconstruct its energy-phase relation at 85 gate voltage points. At half flux quantum, the odd harmonics of the Josephson potential can be suppressed by up to two orders of magnitude relative to the even harmonics, producing a double-well potential dominated by even harmonics with minima near $\pmπ/2$. The ability to control harmonic parity enables supercurrent carried by pairs of Cooper pairs and provides a new building block for Fourier engineering in superconducting circuits.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Realistic qubit environments exhibit structured, frequency-dependent noise spectra, not just Markovian or low-frequency noise. Understanding error mechanisms at specific frequencies matching dressed-state energy splittings is essential for building high-fidelity quantum processors.

Method: Combined theoretical analysis and experimental verification on superconducting qubits with engineered noise spectra. The study examines how noise at frequencies matching the dressed-state energy splitting (set by inter-qubit coupling strength g) affects gate performance.

Result: Two-qubit gate errors scale predictably with noise power spectral density at frequency 2g, demonstrating a distinct relaxation channel that degrades gate performance. This extends the concept of T₁ρ relaxation to interacting systems and reveals a universal frequency-selective relaxation mechanism.

Conclusion: Noise at frequencies matching dressed-state energy splittings induces a frequency-selective relaxation mechanism that sets coherence limits for two-qubit gates and quantum encodings like dual-rail or singlet-triplet, enriching understanding of decoherence pathways during gate operations.

Abstract: Understanding error mechanisms in two-qubit gate operations is essential for building high-fidelity quantum processors. While prior studies predominantly treat dephasing noise as either Markovian or predominantly low-frequency, realistic qubit environments exhibit structured, frequency-dependent spectra. Here we demonstrate that noise at frequencies matching the dressed-state energy splitting--set by the inter-qubit coupling strength g--induces a distinct relaxation channel that degrades gate performance. Through combined theoretical analysis and experimental verification on superconducting qubits with engineered noise spectra, we show that two-qubit gate errors scale predictably with the noise power spectral density at frequency 2g, extending the concept of $T_{1ρ}$ relaxation to interacting systems. This frequency-selective relaxation mechanism, universal across platforms, enriches our understanding of decoherence pathways during gate operations. The same mechanism sets coherence limits for dual-rail or singlet-triplet encodings.

Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions are topologically protected spin textures known for their robustness against perturbations. Their topological stability makes them robust information carriers, ideal for tackling a key challenge in quantum computing: creating reliable, one-way links between different types of qubits. In this proof-of-concept study, we introduce a novel device - the skyrmion quantum diode - based on skyrmion qubits. Our approach combines classical micromagnetic simulations, achieving skyrmion diameters as small as 3 nm, with quantum circuit models inspired by superconducting qubits. In this work, we demonstrate: (i) unidirectional skyrmion transport via the skyrmion Hall effect in asymmetric junctions, spanning length scales from 20 nm down to 3 nm; (ii) potential compatibility with flux-tunable quantum architectures; and (iii) preliminary insights into anharmonicity in skyrmion-based qubit systems. These results establish both the operational feasibility and the scaling behavior necessary for a hybrid skyrmion-quantum platform. Our work outlines a path toward integrating skyrmion based quantum components into practical device architectures, enabling low-dissipation, unidirectional quantum information transport. This capability is crucial for scalable quantum computing, spintronic logic, and hybrid quantum systems, and opens opportunities for chipscale, pump-free isolators and directional quantum links that enhance readout fidelity, reduce cryogenic load, and support modular skyrmion-superconducting processors

*Markus Frembs,Cihan Okay,Ho Yiu Chung*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper examines connections between measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC) and linear constraint systems (LCS), showing that state-dependent contextuality in MBQC generally doesn't lead to state-independent contextuality in associated LCS solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge two perspectives on quantum contextuality: state-dependent contextuality as a resource in MBQC versus state-independent contextuality in quantum solutions to LCS, and understand their relationship.

Method: Associates linear constraint systems (LCS) to MBQC exhibiting strong state-dependent contextuality, then analyzes whether measurement operators in such MBQC yield quantum solutions to the associated LCS that demonstrate state-independent contextuality.

Result: Main result rules out quantum solutions to associated LCS for a large class of MBQC, showing state-dependent contextuality in MBQC doesn't generally translate to state-independent contextuality in LCS solutions.

Conclusion: The findings both sharpen the distinction between state-dependent and state-independent forms of contextuality and generalize previous results on non-existence of quantum solutions to LCS in finite odd prime dimensions.

Abstract: We combine the study of resources in measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC) with that of quantum solutions to linear constraint systems (LCS). Contextuality of the input state in MBQC has been identified as a key resource for quantum advantage, and in a stronger form, underlies algebraic relations between (measurement) operators which obey classically unsatisfiable (linear) constraints. Here, we compare these two perspectives on contextuality, and study to what extent they are related. More precisely, we associate a LCS to certain MBQC which exhibit strong forms of state-dependent contextuality, and ask if the measurement operators in such MBQC give rise to state-independent contextuality in the form of quantum solutions of its associated LCS. Our main result rules out such quantum solutions for a large class of MBQC. This both sharpens the distinction between state-dependent and state-independent forms of contextuality, and further generalises results on the non-existence of quantum solutions to LCS in finite odd (prime) dimension.

Result: Achieved 60% overall photon detection efficiency in the setup, with 95% of photons at the measurement TED input being detected. Reset and photon emission/detection each require about 2μs, resulting in a minimum protocol duration of 4μs for the chosen TED parameters.

Conclusion: Transmon-waveguide links like the DTC serve crucial roles in quantum information processors by providing mechanisms for unconditional fast reset, metrology, and as emerging quantum communication interfaces for quantum networking applications.

Abstract: We showcase the recently developed double transmon coupler (DTC) circuit as a compact, drop-in, tunable and transition-selective link between an otherwise coherent transmon and the continuum of modes in a waveguide. We use these transmon-DTC devices as transmon emitter/dectectors (TEDs) for microwave photons. We highlight the flexibility of these devices by sending photons from a source TED to a measurement TED using a meter of coaxial cable and a circulator, each TED with nominally identical circuit parameters. We detect $60\,\%$ of the photons using this setup where we infer that $95\,\%$ of the photons at the input of the measurement TED are detected. Reset and photon emission/detection each require about $2\,μ$s, for a minimum protocol duration of $4\,μ$s, for our choice of TED parameters. Transmon-waveguide links like the DTC serve an important role in quantum information processors: they provide a mechanism for unconditional fast reset, metrology, and as nascent quantum communication interfaces for quantum networking.

TL;DR: Quantum-enhanced optimization for patient stratification in clinical trials reduces covariate imbalance, improves statistical power, and achieves 100x computational efficiency gains over classical methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical trials suffer from high failure rates and costs due to biological uncertainty and inadequate patient stratification, which causes covariate imbalances that mask treatment effects and reduce statistical power.

Method: Optimization-based, quantum-enhanced approach to patient stratification that minimizes covariate imbalance across numerical and categorical variables without altering protocol design or trial endpoints, using hybrid quantum-classical optimization methods.

Result: Quantum-enhanced pipeline achieved over 100x improvement in computational efficiency compared to classical approaches, enabling up to fivefold increase in statistical significance in treatment effect estimation, reducing treatment-effect dilution and increasing trial sensitivity.

Conclusion: Optimization-driven stratification strengthens clinical trial design, improves confidence in downstream decisions, and reduces the risk of costly late-stage failure by enabling better patient stratification and more efficient trial execution.

Abstract: Clinical trials are notorious for their high failure rates and steep costs, leading to wasted time and resources spend, prolonged development timelines, and delayed patient access to new therapies. A key contributor to these failures is biological uncertainty, which complicates trial design and weakens the ability to detect true treatment effects. In particular, inadequate patient stratification often results in covariate imbalances across treatment arms, masking treatment effects and reducing statistical power, even when therapies are effective for specific patient subpopulations. This work presents an optimization-based, quantum-enhanced approach to patient stratification that explicitly minimizes covariate imbalance across numerical and categorical variables, without altering protocol design or trial endpoints. Using real clinical trial data, we demonstrate that hybrid quantum-classical optimization methods achieve high-quality stratification while scaling efficiently to larger cohorts. In our benchmark study, the quantum-enhanced pipeline delivered over a 100x improvement in computational efficiency compared to classical approaches, enabling faster iteration and practical deployment at scale. This report shows how improved stratification can lead to decision-relevant gains, including up to a fivefold increase in statistical significance in treatment effect estimation, reducing treatment-effect dilution and increasing trial sensitivity. Together, these results show that optimization-driven stratification can strengthen clinical trial design, improve confidence in downstream decisions, and reduce the risk of costly late-stage failure.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a more efficient method for implementing continuous-time quantum walks on arbitrary simple sparse graphs in quantum circuits, addressing the resource inefficiency of standard Pauli-based simulation approaches.

Method: The matching decomposition algorithm works by: 1) Decomposing the continuous-time quantum walk Hamiltonian into exactly implementable Hamiltonians corresponding to matchings in the graph, 2) Applying a novel graph compression algorithm that merges edges, 3) Converting the walks to circuits and Trotterizing over components, 4) Implementing walker dynamics on each edge using sequences of CX and CRx gates without Pauli decomposition.

Result: Matching decomposition consistently yields substantial resource reductions compared to standard Pauli-based simulation: up to 43% fewer controlled gates and up to 54% shallower circuits across multiple graph families. The paper also presents examples and theoretical results for when matching decomposition can exactly simulate continuous-time quantum walks.

Conclusion: Matching decomposition provides an efficient alternative to Pauli-based methods for implementing continuous-time quantum walks on sparse graphs, offering significant reductions in gate count and circuit depth while enabling exact simulation in certain cases.

Abstract: In this work, we present a new algorithm for generating quantum circuits that efficiently implement continuous time quantum walks on arbitrary simple sparse graphs. The algorithm, called matching decomposition, works by decomposing a continuous-time quantum walk Hamiltonian into a collection of exactly implementable Hamiltonians corresponding to matchings in the underlying graph followed by a novel graph compression algorithm that merges edges in the graph. Lastly, we convert the walks to a circuit and Trotterize over these components. The dynamics of the walker on each edge in the matching can be implemented in the circuit model as sequences of CX and CRx gates. We do not use Pauli decomposition when implementing walks along each matching. Furthermore, we compare matching decomposition to a standard Pauli-based simulation pipeline and find that matching decomposition consistently yields substantial resource reductions, requiring up to 43% fewer controlled gates and up to 54% shallower circuits than Pauli decomposition across multiple graph families. Finally, we also present examples and theoretical results for when matching decomposition can exactly simulate a continuous-time quantum walk on a graph.

Method: The researchers investigate a driven quantum resonator whose temperature is controlled by modulating its natural frequency. They evaluate work performed by external drive and resulting heat flow between resonator and environment, analyzing both within linear response and beyond. They determine the full distribution of photon exchanges characterized by its first few cumulants.

Abstract: A central building block of a heat engine is the working fluid, which mediates the conversion of heat into work. In nanoscale heat engines, the working fluid can be a quantum system whose behavior and dynamics are non-classical. A particularly versatile realization is a quantum resonator, which allows for precise control and coupling to thermal reservoirs, making it an ideal platform for exploring quantum thermodynamic processes. Here, we investigate the thermodynamic properties of a driven quantum resonator whose temperature is controlled by modulating its natural frequency. We evaluate the work performed by the external drive and the resulting heat flow between the resonator and its environment, both within linear response and beyond. To further elucidate these processes, we determine the full distribution of photon exchanges between the resonator and its environment, characterized by its first few cumulants. Our results provide quantitative insights into the interplay between heat, work, and fluctuations, and may help in designing future heat engines.

Motivation: To understand how complex next-nearest-neighbor hoppings affect flat-band localization mechanisms and topological properties in 2D Lieb lattices, particularly the interplay between topological edge states and disorder effects.

Method: Utilized transfer matrix method to study flat-band localization with complex NNN hoppings, analyzed topological edge states under weak disorder, and investigated correlated disorders using Chern number calculations.

Result: Geometric localization in flat bands can be alleviated by topological edge states under weak disorder; correlated disorders induce inverse Anderson transitions with topological edge states persisting under strong disorder; Chern number calculations confirm robustness.

Conclusion: The findings establish a unified platform for investigating topological phase transitions, flat bands, and disorder effects in Lieb lattices with complex hoppings.

Abstract: For two-dimensional Lieb lattice, while intrinsic spin-orbit coupling is responsible for opening the gap that exhibits the quantum spin Hall effect, topological phase transitions are driven by a real next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) hopping. In this work, we utilize the transfer matrix method to study the flat-band localization mechanism in the presence of complex NNN hoppings. We demonstrate that the geometric localization in flat bands can be alleviated by topological edge states under weak disorder. Furthermore, correlated disorders are shown to induce inverse Anderson transition with the topological edge states persisting under strong disorder, a robustness confirmed by Chern number calculations, which identifies the root cause of this phenomenon. These findings establish a unified platform for investigating topological phase transitions, flat bands, and disorder effects.
