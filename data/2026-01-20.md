### [1] [Exponential gain in clock precision using quantum correlated ticks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10785)
*Florian Meier,Yuri Minoguchi,Gianmichele Blasi,Géraldine Haack,Marcus Huber*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Quantum self-correcting clocks achieve exponential precision advantage at ultra-short timescales through quantum correlations and emergent Pauli exclusion principle.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current clock technologies face fundamental precision limits at ultra-short timescales - traditional oscillator-based clocks have long-term stability but poor short-term precision, while stochastic tick approaches have individual precision limitations. There's a need for new paradigms that can operate with high precision at ultra-short timescales.

Method: Proposes autonomous self-correction of consecutive ticks using quantum correlations, integrating insights from quantum transport theory. Fully solves a model of coupled quantum systems where emergent Pauli exclusion principle correlates the clock at quantum level. Demonstrates viability through simulations with realistic imperfections.

Result: Achieves exponential advantage in precision at ultra-short timescales. The quantum correlations provide self-correction mechanism that remains stable even with realistic imperfections, offering a roadmap for implementation with contemporary quantum technologies.

Conclusion: Quantum self-correction via quantum correlations represents a new paradigm for ultra-precise timekeeping at short timescales, overcoming fundamental limitations of existing approaches and providing implementable solutions with current quantum technologies.

Abstract: Creating precise timing devices at ultra-short time scales is not just an important technological challenge, but confronts us with foundational questions about timekeeping's ultimate precision limits. Research on clocks has either focused on long-term stability using an oscillator stabilized by a level transition, limiting precision at short timescales, or on making individual stochastic ticks as precise as possible. Here, we prove the viability of a conceptually different avenue: the autonomous self-correction of consecutive ticks by quantum correlations. This provides a new paradigm that integrates the advantages and insights from quantum transport theory to operate clocks at ultra-short timescales. We fully solve a model of coupled quantum systems and show how the emergent Pauli exclusion principle correlates the clock at the quantum level yielding an exponential advantage in precision. We furthermore demonstrate through simulations with realistic imperfections that this remarkable gain in precision remains stable providing a roadmap for implementation with contemporary quantum technologies.

### [2] [Elevator Codes: Concatenation for resource-efficient quantum memory under biased noise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10786)
*Peter Shanahan,Diego Ruiz*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A new 2D local code construction using concatenated classical codes reduces qubit overhead by over 50% for highly biased noise (η≥7×10⁴), outperforming rectangular surface codes and XZZX codes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing biased-noise qubit codes face limitations: rectangular surface codes have low thresholds, while XZZX codes require twice as many physical qubits to maintain the same distance as surface codes. There's a need for more efficient error correction under highly biased noise conditions.

Method: Concatenation of two classical codes: inner repetition phase-flip codes handle phase errors, and outer high-rate bit-flip codes address residual bit-flip errors. The outer codes are implemented at the logical level to circumvent device connectivity constraints.

Result: The construction reduces qubit overhead by over 50% at p_Z=10⁻³ and η=2×10⁶ to achieve logical error rate of 10⁻¹², outperforming existing codes for noise biases η≥7×10⁴.

Conclusion: Under sufficiently biased noise, it's advantageous to address phase-flip and bit-flip errors at different coding layers: inner codes should prioritize high threshold for phase errors, while outer codes should optimize encoding rate efficiency for residual bit-flip errors.

Abstract: Biased-noise qubits, in which one type of error (e.g. $X$- and $Y$-type errors) is significantly suppressed relative to the other (e.g. $Z$-type errors), can significantly reduce the overhead of quantum error correction. Codes such as the rectangular surface code or XZZX code substantially reduce the qubit overhead under biased noise, but they still face challenges. The rectangular surface code suffers from a relatively low threshold, while the XZZX code requires twice as many physical qubits to maintain the same code distance as the surface code. In this work, we introduce a 2D local code construction that outperforms these codes for noise biases $η\ge 7\times10^{4}$, reducing the qubit overhead by over 50% at $p_Z=10^{-3}$ and $η= 2 \times 10^6$ to achieve a logical error rate of $10^{-12}$. Our construction relies on the concatenation of two classical codes. The inner codes are repetition phase-flip codes while the outer codes are high-rate bit-flip codes enabled by their implementation at the logical level, which circumvents device connectivity constraints. These results indicate that under sufficiently biased noise, it is advantageous to address phase-flip and bit-flip errors at different layers of the coding scheme. The inner code should prioritize a high threshold for phase-flip errors, while the bit-flip outer code should optimize for encoding rate efficiency. In the strong biased-noise regime, high-rate outer codes keep the overhead for correcting residual bit-flip errors comparable to that of the repetition code itself, meaningfully lower than that required by earlier approaches.

### [3] [Critical non-equilibrium phases from noisy topological memories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10792)
*Amir-Reza Negari,Subhayan Sahu,Jan Behrends,Benjamin Béri,Timothy H. Hsieh*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper identifies an extended non-equilibrium critical phase in the surface code under heralded random Pauli measurements, characterized by sub-exponential CMI decay and partial logical information retention that requires global decoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the nature of quantum information in non-equilibrium phases of matter, particularly how measurement-induced criticality affects quantum error correction codes like the surface code, and to characterize the decodability of logical information in such phases.

Method: Mapping the mixed state of the surface code under heralded random Pauli measurements to a completely packed loop model on a square lattice, then using analytic results from loop models to analyze conditional mutual information (CMI) decay and introducing punctured coherent information as a diagnostic for quasi-local decoding capability.

Result: Discovery of an extended critical phase with polylogarithmic CMI decay, where partial logical information persists but can only be recovered by global decoders, not by any quasi-local decoder, as demonstrated by the punctured coherent information diagnostic.

Conclusion: The surface code under heralded measurements exhibits a non-equilibrium critical phase with distinct information-theoretic properties, where logical information becomes globally encoded and inaccessible to local decoders, providing insights into measurement-induced phase transitions in quantum error correction.

Abstract: We demonstrate the existence of an extended non-equilibrium critical phase, characterized by sub-exponential decay of conditional mutual information (CMI), in the surface code subject to heralded random Pauli measurement channels. By mapping the resulting mixed state to the ensemble of completely packed loops on a square lattice, we relate the extended phase to the Goldstone phase of the loop model. In particular, CMI is controlled by the characteristic length scale of loops, and we use analytic results of the latter to establish polylogarithmic decay of CMI in the critical phase. We find that the critical phase retains partial logical information that can be recovered by a global decoder, but not by any quasi-local decoder. To demonstrate this, we introduce a diagnostic called punctured coherent information which provides a necessary condition for quasi-local decoding.

### [4] [Parent Hamiltonians for stabilizer quantum many-body scars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10805)
*Shane Dooley*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: General construction method for embedding stabilizer states as quantum many-body scars in local Hamiltonians using factorizable Pauli strings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum many-body scars represent weak ergodicity breaking in many-body systems, and there's interest in systematically constructing Hamiltonians with such non-thermal eigenstates.

Method: Uses factorizability of Pauli strings on lattices to convert stabilizer elements into local, few-body operators that annihilate stabilizer states, enabling systematic construction of parent Hamiltonians with zero-energy stabilizer QMBS.

Result: Method reproduces known results (rainbow QMBS, entangled antipodal Bell pair) and constructs new examples including cluster state, toric code state, and volume-law entangled antipodal toric code state.

Conclusion: Provides unified framework for constructing stabilizer QMBS with various entanglement structures, confirmed by exact diagonalization showing these states as exact eigenstates of their parent Hamiltonians.

Abstract: Quantum many-body scars (QMBS) have attracted considerable interest due to their role in weak ergodicity breaking in many-body systems. We present a general construction that embeds stabilizer states as QMBS of local Hamiltonians. The method relies on a notion of factorizability of Pauli strings on a lattice, which is used to convert stabilizer elements into local, few-body operators that annihilate the stabilizer state. This enables the systematic construction of parent Hamiltonians with zero-energy stabilizer QMBS typically near the middle of the spectrum. The method reproduces several known results in a unified framework, including recent examples of volume-law entangled QMBS, such as the ``rainbow'' QMBS and the entangled antipodal Bell pair state. We also apply the framework to construct examples of stabilizer QMBS with a more complex entanglement structure, such as the cluster state, the toric code state, and a volume-law entangled state we dub the antipodal toric code (ATC) state. Exact diagonalization confirms our results and reveal the stabilizer states as exact eigenstates of their parent Hamiltonian.

### [5] [Charging a quantum battery from the Bloch sphere](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10844)
*C. A. Downing,M. S. Ukhtary*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Analytical study of quantum battery charging with charger qubit initialized anywhere on Bloch sphere, revealing dependence of stored energy, ergotropy, and capacity on initial polar angle, with implications for quantum thermodynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate quantum energetics and thermodynamics of a simple two-component quantum battery model (charger qubit + battery qubit) with arbitrary initial charger states, going beyond standard approaches that disregard thermodynamic considerations.

Method: Analytical derivation of generalized expressions for stored energy, ergotropy, and capacity of a quantum battery model consisting of coupled charger and battery qubits, allowing initial charger state anywhere on Bloch sphere surface.

Result: Found that stored energy, ergotropy, and capacity depend on initial Bloch sphere polar angle in a manner reminiscent of quantum area theorem; ergotropy originates from quantum coherences and population inversions; ergotropic charging power and optimal charging time deviate from standard results ignoring thermodynamics.

Conclusion: Theoretical framework provides groundwork for guiding future quantum energy experiments with coupled two-level systems, highlighting importance of thermodynamic considerations in quantum battery performance and the role of initial quantum state preparation.

Abstract: We reconsider the quantum energetics and quantum thermodynamics of the charging process of a simple, two-component quantum battery model made up of a charger qubit and a single--cell battery qubit. We allow for the initial quantum state of the charger to lie anywhere on the surface of the Bloch sphere, and find the generalized analytical expressions describing the stored energy, ergotropy and capacity of the battery, all of which depend upon the initial Bloch sphere polar angle in a manner evocative of the quantum area theorem. The origin of the ergotropy produced, as well as the genesis of the battery capacity, can be readily traced back to the quantum coherences and population inversions generated (and the balance between these two mechanisms is contingent upon the starting Bloch polar angle). Importantly, the ergotropic charging power and its associated optimal charging time display notable deviations from standard results which disregard thermodynamic considerations. Our theoretical groundwork may be useful for guiding forthcoming experiments in quantum energy science based upon coupled two-level systems.

### [6] [Efficient Quantum Circuits for the Hilbert Transform](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10876)
*Henry Zhang,Joseph Li*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Quantum algorithm for discrete Hilbert transform with polylogarithmic size and logarithmic depth, exponentially faster than classical methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Hilbert transform is powerful for non-stationary signals and anomaly detection, but no efficient quantum implementations existed despite quantum Fourier and wavelet transforms being well-established.

Method: Novel construction for quantum Hilbert transform with polylogarithmic size and logarithmic depth for length N signals, generalized to d-dimensional Hilbert transform in O(d log N) depth.

Result: Exponentially fewer operations than classical algorithms, with simulations showing effectiveness for power systems control and image processing, achieving exact agreement with classical results.

Conclusion: First efficient quantum implementation of discrete Hilbert transform, providing exponential speedup over classical methods for signal processing applications.

Abstract: The quantum Fourier transform and quantum wavelet transform have been cornerstones of quantum information processing. However, for non-stationary signals and anomaly detection, the Hilbert transform can be a more powerful tool, yet no prior work has provided efficient quantum implementations for the discrete Hilbert transform. This letter presents a novel construction for a quantum Hilbert transform in polylogarithmic size and logarithmic depth for a signal of length $N$, exponentially fewer operations than classical algorithms for the same mapping. We generalize this algorithm to create any $d$-dimensional Hilbert transform in depth $O(d\log N)$. Simulations demonstrate effectiveness for tasks such as power systems control and image processing, with exact agreement with classical results.

### [7] [Two-tooth bosonic quantum comb for temporal-correlation sensing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10916)
*Shaojiang Zhu,Xinyuan You,Alexander Romanenko,Anna Grassellino*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A two-tooth bosonic quantum comb enables multi-time coherence transport analysis between thermal absorber and coherent probe, allowing bosonic noise spectroscopy that distinguishes Markovian temperature noise from structured fluctuations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a method for probing fluctuating bosonic environments that captures both instantaneous fluctuations and their temporal correlations, enabling discrimination between different types of bosonic noise in quantum systems.

Method: Introduces a two-tooth bosonic quantum comb that captures sequential interactions between thermal absorber and long-lived coherent probe. Uses process-tensor formulation to derive closed-form expressions for coherence transport, analyzing interference between two interaction windows to reveal non-monotonic memory response.

Result: The probe directly samples the absorber's population correlator by sweeping temporal separation between interaction windows, enabling bosonic noise spectroscopy that discriminates Markovian temperature noise from slow or spectrally structured fluctuations. The approach reveals fundamental competition between thermal population and dynamical correlations.

Conclusion: The two-tooth bosonic quantum comb provides a general method for probing fluctuating bosonic environments, compatible with circuit-QED platforms, offering causal multi-time description of coherence transport and enabling discrimination between different types of bosonic fluctuations.

Abstract: We introduce a two-tooth bosonic quantum comb that captures the sequential interactions between a thermal absorber and a long-lived coherent probe. The comb provides a causal, multi-time description of coherence transport, tracking how the probe records both instantaneous fluctuations and their temporal correlations. Using a process-tensor formulation, we derive closed form expressions showing that interference between the two interaction windows generates a non-monotonic memory response that reflects a fundamental competition between the absorbers thermal population and its dynamical correlations. By sweeping the temporal separation between the interaction windows, the probe directly samples the absorbers population correlator, enabling bosonic noise spectroscopy that discriminates Markovian temperature noise from slow or spectrally structured fluctuations. The approach is readily compatible with circuit-QED platforms and offers a general method for probing fluctuating bosonic environments.

### [8] [Quantum trajectories for time-binned data and their closeness to fully conditioned quantum trajectories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10937)
*Nattaphong Wonglakhon,Areeya Chantasri,Howard M. Wiseman*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper analyzes finite-interval dynamical maps for quantum trajectories conditioned on time-binned measurement data, showing that while binned average current data yields nearly pure states, the distance from true continuous-time conditioned states scales poorly, and introduces a new Φ-map with better scaling using an additional statistic.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is renewed interest in dynamical maps for quantum trajectories with finite time intervals, particularly for experimentally relevant cases where only average current over each interval is available. The authors aim to improve the accuracy of conditioned states derived from binned measurement data compared to the true continuous-time conditioned states.

Method: The authors analyze the scaling properties of different dynamical maps: (1) the binned average current map (ρ_Faucet), (2) a new Φ-map that uses both average current I_t and an additional real statistic φ_t of the current, (3) the lowest-order (Itô) map, and (4) two other higher-order maps. They derive analytical scaling results and numerically verify the error scaling (distance from true continuous-time conditioned states).

Result: The binned average current map yields states with impurity scaling as (Δt)^3 but typical distance from true continuous-time conditioned states scales as (Δt)^{3/2}. The new Φ-map, using both I_t and φ_t, produces states with distance scaling as (Δt)^2 from the true continuous-time conditioned states, outperforming all other maps for generic systems when φ_t can be extracted experimentally.

Conclusion: For generic quantum systems, if the additional statistic φ_t can be extracted from experimental data along with average current I_t, the Φ-map provides superior accuracy (quadratic scaling in Δt) compared to other finite-interval dynamical maps, making it the optimal choice for reconstructing conditioned quantum states from binned measurement data.

Abstract: Quantum trajectories are dynamical equations for quantum states conditioned on the results of a time-continuous measurement, such as a continuous-in-time current $\vec y_t$. Recently there has been renewed interest in dynamical maps for quantum trajectories with time-intervals of finite size $Δt$. Guilmin \emph{et al.} (unpublished) derived such a dynamical map for the (experimentally relevant) case where only the average current $I_t$ over each interval is available. Surprisingly, this binned data still generates a conditioned state $ρ_\text{\faFaucet}$ that is almost pure (for efficient measurements), with an impurity scaling as $(Δt)^{3}$. We show that, nevertheless, the typical distance of $ρ_\text{\faFaucet}$ from $\hatψ_{\text{F}; \vec y_t}$ -- the projector for the pure state conditioned on the full current -- is as large as $(Δt)^{3/2}$. We introduce another finite-interval dynamical map (``$Φ$-map''), which requires only one additional real statistic, $φ_t$, of the current in the interval, that gives a conditioned state $\hatψ_Φ$ which is only $(Δt)^{2}$-distant from $\hatψ_{\text{F}; \vec y_t}$. We numerically verify these scalings of the error (distance from the true states) for these two maps, as well as for the lowest-order (Itô) map and two other higher-order maps. Our results show that, for a generic system, if the statistic $φ_t$ can be extracted from experiment along with $I_t$, then the $Φ$-map gives a smaller error than any other.

*Yuan Li,Zhengli Chen,Zhihua Guo,Yongfeng Pang*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Analysis of quantum channel norms and their complementary channels, with results on extremal values, infinite-dimensional CP maps preserving pure states, and matrix integrals over unit spheres.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To characterize the range of possible values for the sum of squared Hilbert-Schmidt norms of quantum channels and their complementary channels, and to understand quantum channels achieving extremal values. Additionally, to study completely positive maps on infinite-dimensional systems that preserve pure states, and to investigate matrix integrals over unit spheres.

Method: Mathematical analysis of quantum channels using Hilbert-Schmidt norms and complementary channel formalism. Study of completely positive maps on infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. Development and demonstration of equivalency between various matrix integrals over unit spheres, with extensions to more general cases.

Result: Determined the range of possible values for ∥ℰ∥₂² + ∥ℰ̃∥₂², with equivalent characterizations for quantum channels achieving maximum and minimum values. Obtained concrete description of completely positive maps on infinite-dimensional systems that preserve pure states. Demonstrated equivalency of several matrix integrals over unit spheres and obtained extensions of these integrals.

Conclusion: The paper provides mathematical characterizations of quantum channels based on their Hilbert-Schmidt norms and complementary channels, establishes properties of infinite-dimensional CP maps preserving pure states, and advances the theory of matrix integrals over unit spheres with new equivalency results and extensions.

Abstract: The dynamics of quantum systems are generally described by a family of quantum channels (linear, completely positive and trace preserving maps). In this note, we mainly study the range of all possible values of $\|\mathcal{E}\|_2^2+\|\widetilde{\mathcal{E}}\|_2^2$ for quantum channels $\mathcal{E}$ and give the equivalent characterizations for quantum channels that achieve these maximum and minimum values, respectively, where $\|\mathcal{E}\|_2$ is the Hilbert-Schmidt norm of $\mathcal{E}$ and $\widetilde{\mathcal{E}}$ is a complementary channel of $\mathcal{E}.$ Also, we get a concrete description of completely positive maps on infinite dimensional systems preserving pure states. Moreover, the equivalency of several matrix integrals over the unit sphere is demonstrated and some extensions of these matrix integrals are obtained.

### [10] [The two-time Leggett-Garg inequalities of a superconducting qubit interacting with thermal photons in a cavity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10946)
*Hiroo Azuma*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper studies Leggett-Garg inequality violations in a Josephson-junction qubit interacting with magnetic flux, showing temperature-dependent power-law decay of quantum coherence signatures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate quantum coherence and macroscopic realism in a non-exactly-solvable quantum optical model involving a Josephson-junction qubit interacting with photons, extending previous exactly-solvable models to understand temperature effects on Leggett-Garg inequality violations.

Method: The model uses a Josephson-junction qubit interacting with photons via a quadratic interaction term (square of linear combination of annihilation/creation operators). Since the model is not exactly solvable, the authors employ second-order perturbation theory to approximate time evolution and numerically calculate two-time Leggett-Garg inequalities.

Result: Numerical calculations show that Leggett-Garg inequality violations diminish with increasing temperature following power-law behavior. The exponents of these power laws depend on the coupling constant between qubit and photons. Larger coupling constants reduce both the magnitude of violations and their temperature sensitivity.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that quantum coherence signatures (Leggett-Garg violations) in Josephson-junction qubit systems exhibit temperature-dependent power-law decay, with coupling strength modulating both the magnitude of violations and their thermal robustness, providing insights into decoherence mechanisms in quantum optical systems.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the two-time Leggett-Garg (LG) inequalities of a quantum optical model that appears in the Josephson-junction quantum bit (qubit) interacting with an external magnetic flux. This model is a natural extension of an exactly solvable model whose interaction between a qubit and single-mode photons is given by a product of the Pauli $z$ operator of the qubit and a linear combination of annihilation and creation operators of the photons. By contrast, a photon's part of the interaction of our model is given by the square of the linear combination. Because our model is not solvable, we approximately investigate its time evolution up to the second-order perturbation. Our numerical calculations show that violation of the LG inequality diminishes as the temperature increases. Moreover, it exhibits power laws of the temperature, whose exponents vary depending on the coupling constant of the interaction between the qubit and photons. The violation of the LG inequality decreases and becomes less sensitive to the temperature as the coupling constant of the interaction gets larger.

Conclusion: Establishes fundamental communication rate requirements for distributed simulation of partial quantum measurement outcomes in a three-party setting with shared randomness.

Abstract: In this paper a central server Charlie has access to a quantum system C and measures it with a POVM $\{Λ_x\}$. Alice and Bob are only interested in the partial results $g_A(x)$ respectively $g_B(x)$. Alice, Bob, and Charlie share common randomness and Alice and Bob only need to faithfully simulate their measurements.

*Nicholas J. C. Papadopoulos,Ramin Ayanzadeh*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Universal fault-tolerant quantum computation achieved through novel ancilla-mediated protocols that implement logical Clifford and T gates deterministically without consuming ancilla registers or modifying underlying codes, applicable to all stabilizer codes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing error correcting codes alone cannot achieve universal quantum computation; traditional techniques like code concatenation, code switching, or magic state distillation are costly and code-specific. There's a need for a generic, efficient approach to enable universal fault-tolerant quantum computation across all stabilizer codes.

Method: Implementation of logical Clifford and T gates through novel ancilla-mediated protocols that leverage helper codes in ancilla registers and mid-circuit measurements. The approach is deterministic, doesn't consume ancilla registers, doesn't modify underlying data codes or registers, and is generic over all stabilizer codes.

Result: Any single stabilizer code becomes capable of universal quantum computation. The logical gates are stabilizer code-generic, enabling communication between heterogeneous stabilizer codes. The implementation opens possibilities for existing and undiscovered codes as well as their scalable, heterogeneous coexistence.

Conclusion: The work presents a breakthrough approach that enables universal fault-tolerant quantum computation for any stabilizer code through ancilla-mediated protocols, overcoming limitations of traditional techniques and enabling heterogeneous code coexistence and communication.

Abstract: Fault-tolerant quantum computation allows quantum computations to be carried out while resisting unwanted noise. Several error correcting codes have been developed to achieve this task, but none alone are capable of universal quantum computation. This universality is highly desired and often achieved using additional techniques such as code concatenation, code switching, or magic state distillation, which can be costly and only work for specific codes. This work implements logical Clifford and T gates through novel ancilla-mediated protocols to construct a universal fault-tolerant quantum gate set. Unlike traditional techniques, our implementation is deterministic, does not consume ancilla registers, does not modify the underlying data codes or registers, and is generic over all stabilizer codes. Thus, any single code becomes capable of universal quantum computation by leveraging helper codes in ancilla registers and mid-circuit measurements. Furthermore, since these logical gates are stabilizer code-generic, these implementations enable communication between heterogeneous stabilizer codes. These features collectively open the door to countless possibilities for existing and undiscovered codes as well as their scalable, heterogeneous coexistence.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum architecture search (QAS) automates quantum circuit design, but existing approaches don't adequately address noise in quantum hardware. There's a need for noise-aware QAS to find robust architectures under realistic noisy conditions.

Method: Proposes a noise-aware QAS framework based on variational quantum circuits. Incorporates noise models into PQC training.

Conclusion: The NA-QAS framework effectively automates noise-robust quantum circuit design, addressing the critical challenge of hardware noise in quantum computing while maintaining performance and resource efficiency.

Abstract: Quantum architecture search (QAS) has emerged to automate the design of high-performance quantum circuits under specific tasks and hardware constraints. We propose a noise-aware quantum architecture search (NA-QAS) framework based on variational quantum circuit design. By incorporating a noise model into the training of parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) , the proposed framework identifies the noise-robust architectures. We introduce a hybrid Hamiltonian $\varepsilon$ -greedy strategy to optimize evaluation costs and circumvent local optima. Furthermore, an enhanced variable-depth NSGA-II algorithm is employed to navigate the vast search space, enabling an automated trade-off between architectural expressibility and quantum hardware overhead. The effectiveness of the framework is validated through binary classification and iris multi-classification tasks under a noisy condition. Compared to existing approaches, our framework can search for quantum architectures with superior performance and greater resource efficiency under a noisy condition.

*Si-Min Wang,Ming-Liang Hu,Heng Fan*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Off-resonant interactions preserve and generate quantum imaginarity resources (NAQI and DIA) in distributed two-qubit systems interacting with a lossy cavity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how imaginarity (treating complex numbers as a quantum resource) can be preserved and generated in distributed quantum systems, particularly in the context of two qubits interacting with a lossy cavity.

Method: Study nonlocal advantage of quantum imaginarity (NAQI) and distillable imaginarity of assistance (DIA) for two qubits interacting with a lossy cavity. Analyze effects of large symmetric detuning between qubits and cavity, and unequal qubit-cavity couplings.

Result: Both NAQI and DIA can be well preserved for long times with large symmetric detuning. Off-resonant interactions generate high degrees of NAQI and DIA from initial product states when qubits have same detunings but unequal cavity couplings. Physical mechanism explained via effective qubit-qubit coupling induced by cavity mode.

Conclusion: Off-resonant interactions play a crucial role in efficient control of imaginarity in distributed quantum scenarios, enabling preservation and generation of imaginarity resources despite cavity losses.

Abstract: We study the nonlocal advantage of quantum imaginarity (NAQI) and distillable imaginarity of assistance (DIA), which treat imaginarity as a resource in distributed scenarios. For two qubits interacting with a lossy cavity, it is shown that both the NAQI and DIA can be well preserved for long times in the presence of large and symmetric detuning between the qubits and the cavity. Moreover, the off-resonant interaction generates a high degree of NAQI and DIA from the initial product states of two qubits having the same detunings and unequal couplings to the cavity. Based on the effective coupling of the qubits induced by the cavity mode, we explain the physical mechanism underlying the validity of this strategy. Our findings shed light on the role that off-resonant interactions have in the efficient control of imaginarity in distributed scenarios.

*Chenlu Liu,Yulong Li,Jiahui Wang,Quan Guan,Lijing Jin,Lu Ma,Ruizi Hu,Tenghui Wang,Xing Zhu,Hai-Feng Yu,Chunqing Deng,Xizheng Ma*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Single fluxonium qubit at zero flux enables erasure conversion in 0-2 subspace using engineered resonator for mid-circuit detection and measurement, achieving 4.5× logical lifetime improvement with minimal error per erasure check.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dual-rail encoded erasure qubits in superconducting systems offer fault-tolerant advantages but require increased hardware overhead and circuit complexity. The paper aims to address these limitations by implementing erasure conversion in a simpler, single-qubit architecture.

Method: Uses integer fluxonium operated at zero flux with logical state encoded in 0-2 subspace. A single engineered resonator provides both mid-circuit erasure detection and end-of-line logical measurement. Post-selection is applied to non-erasure outcomes.

Result: Achieved more than four-fold increase in logical lifetime (193 μs to 869 μs) through post-selection. Characterized measurement-induced logical dephasing and inferred negligible error per erasure check (7.2×10⁻⁵).

Conclusion: Integer-fluxonium at zero flux provides a resource-efficient platform for erasure-based error mitigation without additional hardware overhead, establishing it as a promising approach for fault-tolerant quantum computing.

Abstract: Qubits that experience predominantly erasure errors offer distinct advantages for fault-tolerant operation. Indeed, dual-rail encoded erasure qubits in superconducting cavities and transmons have demonstrated high-fidelity operations by converting physical-qubit relaxation into logical-qubit erasures, but this comes at the cost of increased hardware overhead and circuit complexity. Here, we address these limitations by realizing erasure conversion in a single fluxonium operated at zero flux, where the logical state is encoded in its 0-2 subspace. A single, carefully engineered resonator provides both mid-circuit erasure detection and end-of-line (EOL) logical measurement. Post-selection on non-erasure outcomes results in more than four-fold increase of the logical lifetime, from $193~μ$s to $869~μ$s. Finally, we characterize measurement-induced logical dephasing as a function of measurement power and frequency, and infer that each erasure check contributes a negligible error of $7.2\times 10^{-5}$. These results establish integer-fluxonium as a promising, resource-efficient platform for erasure-based error mitigation, without requiring additional hardware.

TL;DR: AI-assisted quantum key distribution using orbital angular momentum on UAVs with turbulence compensation and composable security


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable secure quantum communication on mobile UAV platforms by addressing challenges of atmospheric turbulence, pointing errors, and non-stationary flight conditions that degrade QKD performance.

Method: Developed unified channel model for Kolmogorov turbulence, pointing misalignment, and aperture clipping; used weak+vacuum decoy states with composable finite key analysis; introduced physics-informed learning module for pulse classification and decoding strategy optimization.

Result: Simulations show AI-assisted method improves secret key rate by 10-30% under moderate turbulence and milliradian pointing jitter while maintaining composable security.

Conclusion: The framework enables practical OAM-encoded BB84 QKD on UAVs with turbulence compensation and AI-enhanced performance stabilization, advancing mobile quantum communication systems.

Abstract: We present a theoretical framework for quantum key distribution (QKD) using orbital angular momentum (OAM) encoded BB84 on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) platform. A unified channel model captures Kolmogorov turbulence, pointing induced misalignment, and finite aperture clipping, enabling quantitative predictions of inter mode crosstalk and the resulting quantum bit error rate (QBER). Using a weak plus vacuum decoy state formulation, we derive composable finite key lower bounds on the secret key rate that incorporate statistical fluctuations, detector dark counts, efficiency mismatch, and error correction leakage. To stabilize performance under non stationary flight conditions, we introduce a lightweight physics informed learning module that combines physical priors with measured link statistics to classify valid pulses, reject corrupted data, and recommend decoding strategies. We outline a complete evaluation pipeline including UAV system architecture, turbulence driven QBER maps, decoy optimization, finite key scaling, and AI calibration metrics. Simulations indicate that under moderate turbulence and milliradian level pointing jitter, the proposed AI assisted method can improve the secret key rate by 10 percent to 30 percent while preserving composable security.

*Lucas Happ*

TL;DR: Study of three-body bound states in the continuum (BIC) formation through pole trajectory analysis in complex energy plane, revealing parametric dependence on interaction strength, range, and mass ratio.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the formation mechanism of few-body bound states in the continuum and understand how system parameters affect their emergence, extending characterization beyond previous limited parameter studies.

Method: Used a one-dimensional model of two identical bosons and a distinguishable particle with Gaussian potentials, systematically varying interaction strength, interaction range, and mass ratio while tracing pole trajectories in the complex energy plane.

Result: Confirmed parametric nature of three-body BICs across broader parameter space. Found variations in interaction parameters and mass ratio can lead to BIC formation, with mass ratio variation showing more regular patterns and multiple BIC locations.

Conclusion: Few-body BIC formation mechanism is more sensitive to kinematic structure (mass ratio) than specific details of two-body interactions, suggesting fundamental role of system kinematics in BIC emergence.

Abstract: We investigate the formation of three-body bound states in the continuum by tracing pole trajectories in the complex energy plane under variation of system parameters. Using a one-dimensional model of two identical bosons and a distinguishable particle interacting via Gaussian potentials, we systematically vary the interaction strength, interaction range, and mass ratio. Our results confirm the parametric nature of few-body bound states in a continuum (BIC) and extend this characterization to a broader set of system parameters. Specifically, we find that variations of both interaction parameters and the mass ratio can lead to the formation of at least one three-body BIC. However, the exact shape of trajectories differs, and for the mass ratio variation we find a more regular pattern with multiple BIC locations. These results suggest that the mechanism of few-body BIC formation is more sensitive to the kinematic structure of the problem than to the specific details of the two-body interaction.

TL;DR: A new circular-modulated CCD scheme simultaneously modulates amplitude and phase to create a circularly-polarized field, eliminating systematic pulse-area errors from imperfect RWA and achieving higher gate fidelity than conventional CCD.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address systematic pulse-area errors arising from imperfect rotating wave approximation in fast gates, and to improve robustness against variations in qubit frequency, Rabi drive coupling, and low-frequency noise in qubit arrays.

Method: Proposes a new variant of concatenated continuous driving (CCD) that simultaneously modulates both amplitude and phase of the driving field to generate a circularly-polarized field in the rotating frame, canceling the counter-rotating term in the second rotating frame.

Result: Numerical simulations show CMCCD achieves higher gate fidelity than conventional CCD schemes. Experimental implementation with an electron spin-qubit in isotopically purified 28Si-MOS quantum dot demonstrates significantly improved robustness against static detuning and Rabi frequency errors compared to standard Rabi-drive.

Conclusion: The circular-modulated CCD scheme effectively suppresses noise and systematic errors, showing promise for various physical systems including trapped atoms, cold atoms, superconducting qubits, and NV-centers, particularly for qubit arrays with parameter variations.

Abstract: The rate of coherence loss is lower for a qubit under Rabi drive compared to a freely evolving qubit, $T_{2}^{\rm{Rabi}}>T_{2}^*$.
  Building on this principle, concatenated continuous driving (CCD) keeps the qubit under continuous drive to suppress noise and manipulate dressed states by either phase or amplitude modulation.
  In this work, we propose a new variant of CCD which simultaneously modulates both the amplitude and phase of the driving field to generate a circularly-polarized field in the rotating frame of the carrier frequency.
  This circular-modulated (CM)-CCD cancels the counter-rotating term in the second rotating frame, eliminating a systematic pulse-area error that arises from an imperfect rotating wave approximation for fast gates.
  Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed CMCCD achieves higher gate fidelity than conventional CCD schemes.
  We further implement and compare different CCD protocols using an electron spin-qubit in an isotopically purified $^{28}$Si-MOS quantum dot and evaluate its robustness by applying static detuning and Rabi frequency errors.
  The robustness is significantly improved compared to standard Rabi-drive, showing the effectiveness of this scheme for qubit arrays with variation in qubit frequency, coupling to Rabi drive, and low frequency noise.
  The proposed scheme can be applied to various physical systems, including trapped atoms, cold atoms, superconducting qubits, and NV-centers.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the fundamental connections between shortcuts to adiabaticity (STA) protocols in quantum systems and scattering theory concepts, and to develop a unified framework for analyzing STA completions in both quantum harmonic oscillators and quantum field theory.

Method: Exploits the analogy between one-dimensional quantum mechanics and quantum field theory, using the correspondence between Bogoliubov coefficients in quantum harmonic oscillators and transmission/reflection amplitudes in scattering theory. Analyzes STA protocols through the lens of scattering resonances and reflectionless potentials.

Result: Shows that STA protocols for quantum harmonic oscillators with time-dependent frequency are equivalent to transmission resonances in scattering theory. Demonstrates that STA in quantum field theory with homogeneous backgrounds correspond to reflectionless potentials. Reveals that STA completions can be understood through the anti-squeezing operator using the connection between particle creation and squeezed states.

Conclusion: The paper establishes a unified scattering theory framework for understanding shortcuts to adiabaticity across different quantum systems, providing new insights into STA protocols and their completions through connections with transmission resonances, reflectionless potentials, and squeezing operators.

Abstract: We analyze shortcuts to adiabaticity (STA) and their completions for the quantum harmonic oscillator (QHO) with time-dependent frequency, as well as for quantum field theory (QFT) in non-stationary backgrounds. We exploit the analogy with one-dimensional quantum mechanics, and the well known correspondence between Bogoliubov coefficients in the QHO and transmission/reflection amplitudes in scattering theory. Within this framework, STA protocols for the QHO are equivalent to transmission resonances, while STA in QFT with homogeneous backgrounds correspond to reflectionless potentials. Moreover, using the connection between particle creation and squeezed states, we show how STA completions can be understood in terms of the anti-squeezing operator.

TL;DR: Demonstration of a harmonic parity qubit using parallel aluminum-oxide tunnel junctions and gate-tunable InAs/Al nanowire junction to control Cooper pair tunneling parity, enabling even-harmonic-dominated Josephson potentials.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Superconducting circuits need control over Cooper pair tunneling parity (odd vs even harmonics) for various applications, but accessing even-dominated regimes has been challenging with existing complex architectures.

Method: Created a harmonic parity qubit by combining two aluminum-oxide tunnel junctions in parallel with a gate-tunable InAs/Al nanowire junction in a SQUID configuration, then performed spectroscopy versus flux to reconstruct energy-phase relations at 85 gate voltage points.

Result: At half flux quantum, odd harmonics of the Josephson potential can be suppressed by up to two orders of magnitude relative to even harmonics, producing a double-well potential dominated by even harmonics with minima near ±π/2.

Conclusion: The harmonic parity qubit enables control over harmonic parity, allowing supercurrent carried by pairs of Cooper pairs and providing a new building block for Fourier engineering in superconducting circuits.

Abstract: Superconducting quantum circuits derive their nonlinearity from the Josephson energy-phase relation. Besides the fundamental $\cosφ$ term, this relation can also contain higher Fourier harmonics $\cos(kφ)$ corresponding to correlated tunneling of $k$ Cooper pairs. The parity of the dominant tunneling process, i.e.~whether an odd or even number of Cooper pairs tunnel, results in qualitatively different properties, and controlling this opens up a wide range of applications in superconducting technology. However, access to even-dominated regimes has remained challenging and has so far relied on complex multi-junction or all-hybrid architectures. Here, we demonstrate a simple "harmonic parity qubit" (HPQ); an element that combines two aluminum-oxide tunnel junctions in parallel to a gate-tunable InAs/Al nanowire junction forming a SQUID, and use spectroscopy versus flux to reconstruct its energy-phase relation at 85 gate voltage points. At half flux quantum, the odd harmonics of the Josephson potential can be suppressed by up to two orders of magnitude relative to the even harmonics, producing a double-well potential dominated by even harmonics with minima near $\pmπ/2$. The ability to control harmonic parity enables supercurrent carried by pairs of Cooper pairs and provides a new building block for Fourier engineering in superconducting circuits.

TL;DR: Two-qubit gate errors are shown to scale with noise power at frequency 2g (twice the inter-qubit coupling), revealing a frequency-selective relaxation mechanism that extends T₁ρ concepts to interacting qubit systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Realistic qubit environments exhibit structured, frequency-dependent noise spectra, not just Markovian or low-frequency noise. Understanding error mechanisms at specific frequencies matching dressed-state energy splittings is essential for building high-fidelity quantum processors.

Method: Combined theoretical analysis and experimental verification on superconducting qubits with engineered noise spectra. The study examines how noise at frequencies matching the dressed-state energy splitting (set by inter-qubit coupling strength g) affects gate performance.

Result: Two-qubit gate errors scale predictably with noise power spectral density at frequency 2g, demonstrating a distinct relaxation channel that degrades gate performance. This extends the concept of T₁ρ relaxation to interacting systems and is universal across platforms.

Conclusion: Noise at frequencies matching dressed-state energy splittings induces frequency-selective relaxation that sets coherence limits for gate operations and encodings like dual-rail or singlet-triplet, enriching understanding of decoherence pathways in quantum processors.

Abstract: Understanding error mechanisms in two-qubit gate operations is essential for building high-fidelity quantum processors. While prior studies predominantly treat dephasing noise as either Markovian or predominantly low-frequency, realistic qubit environments exhibit structured, frequency-dependent spectra. Here we demonstrate that noise at frequencies matching the dressed-state energy splitting--set by the inter-qubit coupling strength g--induces a distinct relaxation channel that degrades gate performance. Through combined theoretical analysis and experimental verification on superconducting qubits with engineered noise spectra, we show that two-qubit gate errors scale predictably with the noise power spectral density at frequency 2g, extending the concept of $T_{1ρ}$ relaxation to interacting systems. This frequency-selective relaxation mechanism, universal across platforms, enriches our understanding of decoherence pathways during gate operations. The same mechanism sets coherence limits for dual-rail or singlet-triplet encodings.

Conclusion: Establishes operational feasibility and scaling behavior for hybrid skyrmion-quantum platforms, outlining a path toward integrating skyrmion-based quantum components into practical device architectures for low-dissipation, unidirectional quantum information transport in scalable quantum computing.

Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions are topologically protected spin textures known for their robustness against perturbations. Their topological stability makes them robust information carriers, ideal for tackling a key challenge in quantum computing: creating reliable, one-way links between different types of qubits. In this proof-of-concept study, we introduce a novel device - the skyrmion quantum diode - based on skyrmion qubits. Our approach combines classical micromagnetic simulations, achieving skyrmion diameters as small as 3 nm, with quantum circuit models inspired by superconducting qubits. In this work, we demonstrate: (i) unidirectional skyrmion transport via the skyrmion Hall effect in asymmetric junctions, spanning length scales from 20 nm down to 3 nm; (ii) potential compatibility with flux-tunable quantum architectures; and (iii) preliminary insights into anharmonicity in skyrmion-based qubit systems. These results establish both the operational feasibility and the scaling behavior necessary for a hybrid skyrmion-quantum platform. Our work outlines a path toward integrating skyrmion based quantum components into practical device architectures, enabling low-dissipation, unidirectional quantum information transport. This capability is crucial for scalable quantum computing, spintronic logic, and hybrid quantum systems, and opens opportunities for chipscale, pump-free isolators and directional quantum links that enhance readout fidelity, reduce cryogenic load, and support modular skyrmion-superconducting processors

*Markus Frembs,Cihan Okay,Ho Yiu Chung*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper explores connections between measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC) contextuality and quantum solutions to linear constraint systems (LCS), finding that state-dependent contextuality in MBQC generally does not yield state-independent contextuality via quantum solutions to associated LCS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge two perspectives on quantum contextuality: state-dependent contextuality in MBQC (a resource for quantum advantage) and state-independent contextuality in quantum solutions to LCS, examining their relationship and potential connections.

Method: Associates linear constraint systems (LCS) to MBQC exhibiting strong state-dependent contextuality, then investigates whether measurement operators in such MBQC give rise to quantum solutions of the associated LCS, representing state-independent contextuality.

Result: Main result rules out quantum solutions for a large class of MBQC, showing that state-dependent contextuality in MBQC generally does not lead to state-independent contextuality via quantum solutions to associated LCS.

Conclusion: The work sharpens the distinction between state-dependent and state-independent forms of contextuality and generalizes previous results on non-existence of quantum solutions to LCS in finite odd (prime) dimensions.

Abstract: We combine the study of resources in measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC) with that of quantum solutions to linear constraint systems (LCS). Contextuality of the input state in MBQC has been identified as a key resource for quantum advantage, and in a stronger form, underlies algebraic relations between (measurement) operators which obey classically unsatisfiable (linear) constraints. Here, we compare these two perspectives on contextuality, and study to what extent they are related. More precisely, we associate a LCS to certain MBQC which exhibit strong forms of state-dependent contextuality, and ask if the measurement operators in such MBQC give rise to state-independent contextuality in the form of quantum solutions of its associated LCS. Our main result rules out such quantum solutions for a large class of MBQC. This both sharpens the distinction between state-dependent and state-independent forms of contextuality, and further generalises results on the non-existence of quantum solutions to LCS in finite odd (prime) dimension.

Motivation: To develop compact, tunable interfaces between transmon qubits and waveguide continua for quantum information processing applications including fast reset, metrology, and quantum communication interfaces for quantum networking.

Method: Developed a double transmon coupler (DTC) circuit as a drop-in, tunable link between transmon qubits and waveguide modes. Used these transmon-DTC devices as transmon emitter/detectors (TEDs) for microwave photons, demonstrating photon transmission through coaxial cable and circulator between nominally identical TEDs.

Result: Achieved 60% overall photon detection efficiency with 95% detection efficiency at the measurement TED input. Reset and photon emission/detection each require ~2μs, resulting in minimum protocol duration of 4μs for the chosen TED parameters.

Conclusion: Transmon-waveguide links like the DTC serve crucial roles in quantum information processors by providing mechanisms for unconditional fast reset, metrology, and nascent quantum communication interfaces for quantum networking applications.

Abstract: We showcase the recently developed double transmon coupler (DTC) circuit as a compact, drop-in, tunable and transition-selective link between an otherwise coherent transmon and the continuum of modes in a waveguide. We use these transmon-DTC devices as transmon emitter/dectectors (TEDs) for microwave photons. We highlight the flexibility of these devices by sending photons from a source TED to a measurement TED using a meter of coaxial cable and a circulator, each TED with nominally identical circuit parameters. We detect $60\,\%$ of the photons using this setup where we infer that $95\,\%$ of the photons at the input of the measurement TED are detected. Reset and photon emission/detection each require about $2\,μ$s, for a minimum protocol duration of $4\,μ$s, for our choice of TED parameters. Transmon-waveguide links like the DTC serve an important role in quantum information processors: they provide a mechanism for unconditional fast reset, metrology, and as nascent quantum communication interfaces for quantum networking.

TL;DR: Quantum-enhanced optimization for clinical trial patient stratification reduces covariate imbalance, improves statistical power 5x, and achieves 100x computational efficiency gains over classical methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical trials suffer from high failure rates and costs due to biological uncertainty and inadequate patient stratification, which causes covariate imbalances that mask treatment effects and reduce statistical power.

Method: Optimization-based, quantum-enhanced approach to patient stratification that minimizes covariate imbalance across numerical and categorical variables without altering protocol design or trial endpoints, using hybrid quantum-classical optimization methods.

Result: Quantum-enhanced pipeline delivered over 100x improvement in computational efficiency compared to classical approaches, enabling faster iteration and practical deployment at scale, with up to fivefold increase in statistical significance in treatment effect estimation.

Conclusion: Optimization-driven stratification strengthens clinical trial design, improves confidence in downstream decisions, reduces treatment-effect dilution, increases trial sensitivity, and reduces risk of costly late-stage failure.

Abstract: Clinical trials are notorious for their high failure rates and steep costs, leading to wasted time and resources spend, prolonged development timelines, and delayed patient access to new therapies. A key contributor to these failures is biological uncertainty, which complicates trial design and weakens the ability to detect true treatment effects. In particular, inadequate patient stratification often results in covariate imbalances across treatment arms, masking treatment effects and reducing statistical power, even when therapies are effective for specific patient subpopulations. This work presents an optimization-based, quantum-enhanced approach to patient stratification that explicitly minimizes covariate imbalance across numerical and categorical variables, without altering protocol design or trial endpoints. Using real clinical trial data, we demonstrate that hybrid quantum-classical optimization methods achieve high-quality stratification while scaling efficiently to larger cohorts. In our benchmark study, the quantum-enhanced pipeline delivered over a 100x improvement in computational efficiency compared to classical approaches, enabling faster iteration and practical deployment at scale. This report shows how improved stratification can lead to decision-relevant gains, including up to a fivefold increase in statistical significance in treatment effect estimation, reducing treatment-effect dilution and increasing trial sensitivity. Together, these results show that optimization-driven stratification can strengthen clinical trial design, improve confidence in downstream decisions, and reduce the risk of costly late-stage failure.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for efficient quantum circuit implementations of continuous-time quantum walks on arbitrary sparse graphs, as standard Pauli-based simulation methods are resource-intensive.

Method: Matching decomposition algorithm that decomposes quantum walk Hamiltonian into implementable Hamiltonians corresponding to graph matchings, followed by graph compression to merge edges, and conversion to circuits using CX and CRx gates without Pauli decomposition.

Result: Matching decomposition yields substantial resource reductions: up to 43% fewer controlled gates and up to 54% shallower circuits than Pauli decomposition across multiple graph families, with examples of exact simulation.

Conclusion: Matching decomposition provides an efficient alternative to Pauli-based simulation for continuous-time quantum walks on sparse graphs, offering significant circuit depth and gate count improvements.

Abstract: In this work, we present a new algorithm for generating quantum circuits that efficiently implement continuous time quantum walks on arbitrary simple sparse graphs. The algorithm, called matching decomposition, works by decomposing a continuous-time quantum walk Hamiltonian into a collection of exactly implementable Hamiltonians corresponding to matchings in the underlying graph followed by a novel graph compression algorithm that merges edges in the graph. Lastly, we convert the walks to a circuit and Trotterize over these components. The dynamics of the walker on each edge in the matching can be implemented in the circuit model as sequences of CX and CRx gates. We do not use Pauli decomposition when implementing walks along each matching. Furthermore, we compare matching decomposition to a standard Pauli-based simulation pipeline and find that matching decomposition consistently yields substantial resource reductions, requiring up to 43% fewer controlled gates and up to 54% shallower circuits than Pauli decomposition across multiple graph families. Finally, we also present examples and theoretical results for when matching decomposition can exactly simulate a continuous-time quantum walk on a graph.

Result: Quantitative insights into interplay between heat, work, and fluctuations in quantum thermodynamic systems; characterization of photon exchange statistics through cumulants; understanding of work extraction and heat flow in both linear and nonlinear regimes.

Conclusion: Quantum resonators provide a versatile platform for studying quantum thermodynamics; frequency modulation enables temperature control and work extraction; analysis of photon exchange statistics offers deeper understanding of quantum heat engine operation; results inform design of future nanoscale heat engines.

Abstract: A central building block of a heat engine is the working fluid, which mediates the conversion of heat into work. In nanoscale heat engines, the working fluid can be a quantum system whose behavior and dynamics are non-classical. A particularly versatile realization is a quantum resonator, which allows for precise control and coupling to thermal reservoirs, making it an ideal platform for exploring quantum thermodynamic processes. Here, we investigate the thermodynamic properties of a driven quantum resonator whose temperature is controlled by modulating its natural frequency. We evaluate the work performed by the external drive and the resulting heat flow between the resonator and its environment, both within linear response and beyond. To further elucidate these processes, we determine the full distribution of photon exchanges between the resonator and its environment, characterized by its first few cumulants. Our results provide quantitative insights into the interplay between heat, work, and fluctuations, and may help in designing future heat engines.

Method: Utilized transfer matrix method to study flat-band localization in presence of complex NNN hoppings, analyzed topological edge states under weak disorder, and investigated correlated disorders using Chern number calculations.

Result: Geometric localization in flat bands can be alleviated by topological edge states under weak disorder; correlated disorders induce inverse Anderson transition with topological edge states persisting under strong disorder; Chern number calculations confirm robustness.

Conclusion: Complex NNN hoppings create a unified platform for investigating topological phase transitions, flat bands, and disorder effects, revealing novel phenomena like inverse Anderson transitions and persistent topological edge states under strong disorder.

Abstract: For two-dimensional Lieb lattice, while intrinsic spin-orbit coupling is responsible for opening the gap that exhibits the quantum spin Hall effect, topological phase transitions are driven by a real next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) hopping. In this work, we utilize the transfer matrix method to study the flat-band localization mechanism in the presence of complex NNN hoppings. We demonstrate that the geometric localization in flat bands can be alleviated by topological edge states under weak disorder. Furthermore, correlated disorders are shown to induce inverse Anderson transition with the topological edge states persisting under strong disorder, a robustness confirmed by Chern number calculations, which identifies the root cause of this phenomenon. These findings establish a unified platform for investigating topological phase transitions, flat bands, and disorder effects.
