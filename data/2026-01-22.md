### [1] [Anomalous Localization and Mobility Edges in Non-Hermitian Quasicrystals with Disordered Imaginary Gauge Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14754)
*Guolin Nan,Zhijian Li,Feng Mei,Zhihao Xu*

Main category: cond-mat.dis-nn

TL;DR: A study of anomalous localization in a 1D non-Hermitian quasicrystal with disordered imaginary gauge field, revealing transitions between erratic non-Hermitian skin effect phases and localized phases, anomalous mobility edges, and novel dynamical probes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand anomalous localization phenomena in non-Hermitian quasicrystals with disordered imaginary gauge fields, particularly the transitions between different phases and the nature of mobility edges in such systems.

Method: Study a generalized Aubry-André-Harper chain with asymmetric nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor hoppings generated by a Bernoulli imaginary gauge field and quasiperiodic onsite potential. Analyze spectral properties, topological winding numbers, Lyapunov exponents, center-of-mass fluctuations, and dynamical wave-packet expansion.

Result: 1) In standard non-Hermitian AAH limit, transition from fully erratic non-Hermitian skin effect phase to fully localized phase. 2) Fractal dimension cannot distinguish phases, but Lyapunov exponent and center-of-mass fluctuations provide sharp diagnostics. 3) Transition accompanied by complex-to-real spectral change and topological change of spectral winding number. 4) With next-nearest-neighbor hopping, anomalous mobility edge separates Anderson-localized states from ENHSE states (not extended states). 5) Mobility edge captured by energy-dependent winding number that vanishes in localized regime. 6) Dynamical probe shows winding-controlled drift, disorder-selected pinning/boundary-wrapping recurrence, while disorder averaging restores Hermitian-like transport.

Conclusion: The work provides practical spectral, topological, and dynamical diagnostics for anomalous localization and mobility edges in non-Hermitian quasicrystals, revealing novel phase transitions and anomalous mobility edges that differ fundamentally from Hermitian systems.

Abstract: We study anomalous localization in a one-dimensional non-Hermitian quasicrystal with a spatially disordered imaginary gauge field. The system is a generalized Aubry-André-Harper (AAH) chain with asymmetric nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor hoppings generated by a Bernoulli imaginary gauge field and a quasiperiodic onsite potential. In the standard non-Hermitian AAH limit, the system undergoes a transition from a fully erratic non-Hermitian skin effect (ENHSE) phase to a fully localized phase. We show that the fractal dimension cannot distinguish these phases, whereas the Lyapunov exponent and center-of-mass fluctuations provide sharp diagnostics. This transition is accompanied by a complex-to-real spectral change under periodic boundary conditions and a topological change of the spectral winding number. With next-nearest-neighbor hopping, we uncover an anomalous mobility edge separating Anderson-localized states from ENHSE states, rather than extended states. This mobility edge is captured by an energy-dependent winding number that vanishes in the localized regime. Finally, we propose a dynamical probe based on wave-packet expansion: for typical disorder realizations, the dynamics shows winding-controlled drift and disorder-selected pinning or boundary-wrapping recurrence, while disorder averaging restores Hermitian-like transport. These results offer practical spectral, topological, and dynamical diagnostics of anomalous localization and mobility edges in non-Hermitian quasicrystals.

### [2] [Learning and extrapolating scale-invariant processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14810)
*Anaclara Alvez-Canepa,Cyril Furtlehner,François Landes*

Main category: cond-mat.dis-nn

TL;DR: The paper investigates how machine learning can regress scale-free processes with power law behavior, focusing on predicting rare large events requiring extrapolation. It tests various architectures on two self-similar problems to understand how to leverage scale invariance for extrapolation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning has transformed fields like language and vision, and could potentially analyze complex systems. The paper aims to understand how ML can regress scale-free processes (showing power law behavior like earthquakes) and predict rare large events that require extrapolation beyond training data.

Method: The study uses two statistically self-similar paradigmatic problems: 1) 2D fractional Gaussian field with linear dynamics, and 2) Abelian sandpile model with self-organized criticality. Experiments are conducted on various architectures: U-net, Riesz network (scale invariant), wavelet-based Graph Neural Network (discrete scale symmetry), Fourier embedding layer, and Fourier-Mellin Neural Operator.

Result: Based on experiments and complete characterization of the linear case, the paper identifies main issues related to spectral biases and coarse-grained representations. It discusses how to alleviate these issues with relevant inductive biases for scale-invariant extrapolation.

Conclusion: The research explores how to leverage scale invariance for extrapolation in ML models, identifying key challenges with spectral biases and coarse-grained representations, and proposes architectural solutions to incorporate the relevant inductive biases for predicting rare events in scale-free processes.

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) has deeply changed some fields recently, like Language and Vision and we may expect it to be relevant also to the analysis of of complex systems. Here we want to tackle the question of how and to which extent can one regress scale-free processes, i.e. processes displaying power law behavior, like earthquakes or avalanches? We are interested in predicting the large ones, i.e. rare events in the training set which therefore require extrapolation capabilities of the model. For this we consider two paradigmatic problems that are statistically self-similar. The first one is a 2-dimensional fractional Gaussian field obeying linear dynamics, self-similar by construction and amenable to exact analysis. The second one is the Abelian sandpile model, exhibiting self-organized criticality. The emerging paradigm of Geometric Deep Learning shows that including known symmetries into the model's architecture is key to success. Here one may hope to extrapolate only by leveraging scale invariance. This is however a peculiar symmetry, as it involves possibly non-trivial coarse-graining operations and anomalous scaling. We perform experiments on various existing architectures like U-net, Riesz network (scale invariant by construction), or our own proposals: a wavelet-decomposition based Graph Neural Network (with discrete scale symmetry), a Fourier embedding layer and a Fourier-Mellin Neural Operator. Based on these experiments and a complete characterization of the linear case, we identify the main issues relative to spectral biases and coarse-grained representations, and discuss how to alleviate them with the relevant inductive biases.

### [3] [Advances in non-Hermitian dynamics of quadratic bosonic systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14329)
*Huawei Zhao,Xinlei Liu,Xinyao Huang,Guofeng Zhang*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Quadratic bosonic systems with squeezing interactions exhibit intrinsic non-Hermitian dynamics despite having Hermitian Hamiltonians, enabling nonreciprocal transmission and non-Hermitian topological phenomena with applications in signal amplification and quantum non-Hermitian physics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional non-Hermitian systems require asymmetric couplings or dissipation/gain, but quadratic bosonic systems with squeezing interactions naturally exhibit non-Hermitian dynamics in their evolution matrices despite having Hermitian Hamiltonians. This provides a new platform to explore non-Hermitian phenomena and their impact on quantum effects, bridging non-Hermitian and quantum physics.

Method: Analyze quadratic bosonic systems with squeezing interactions, showing their dynamical evolution matrices are non-Hermitian in both real and momentum spaces. Apply field-operator transformation xp to reveal quadrature nonreciprocal transmission. Use Bogoliubov-de Gennes framework in momentum space to study non-Hermitian topological phenomena including point-gap topology and non-Hermitian skin effect from spectra with nonzero winding numbers.

Result: Quadratic bosonic systems enable nonreciprocal transmission between x and p operators for signal amplification applications. They exhibit non-Hermitian topological phenomena including point-gap topology and non-Hermitian skin effect. The systems can realize non-Hermitian Aharonov-Bohm cages and extend non-Bloch band theory, providing a platform to study how non-Hermitian properties affect quantum effects.

Conclusion: Quadratic bosonic systems with squeezing interactions offer a natural platform for non-Hermitian physics without requiring external dissipation or gain. They bridge the gap between non-Hermitian phenomena and quantum effects, opening new research directions at the interface of non-Hermitian and quantum physics, with potential applications in signal processing and topological phenomena.

Abstract: Non-Hermitian physics has emerged as a rapidly advancing field of research, revealing a range of novel phenomena and potential applications. Traditional non-Hermitian Hamiltonians are typically simulated by constructing asymmetric couplings or by introducing dissipation and gain to realize non-Hermitian systems. The quadratic bosonic system (QBS) with squeezing interaction is intrinsically Hermitian; however, its dynamical evolution matrix in both real and momentum spaces is non-Hermitian. Based on this, applying a field-operator transformation xp to the dynamical evolution matrix yields quadrature nonreciprocal transmission between the x and p operators. This nonreciprocal characteristic can be utilized in signal amplifiers. On the other hand, within the Bogoliubov-de Gennes framework in momentum space, one can observe non-Hermitian topological phenomena such as point-gap topology and the non-Hermitian skin effect, both induced by spectra with nonzero winding numbers. Additionally, QBS can be employed to realize non-Hermitian Aharonov-Bohm cages and to extend non-Bloch band theory. Previous studies in non-Hermitian physics have largely concentrated on classical systems. The influence of non-Hermitian properties on quantum effects remains a key issue awaiting exploration and has evolved into a research direction at the interface of non-Hermitian and quantum physics.

### [4] [Towards Device-Independent Quantum Key Distribution with Photonic Devices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14373)
*Corentin Lanore,Xavier Valcarce,Jean Etesse,Anthony Martin,Jean-Daniel Bancal*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Photonic DIQKD feasibility analysis using efficient SDP hierarchy and finite-statistics methods shows proposed optical circuit has sufficient noise tolerance for experimental realization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DIQKD provides stronger security by reducing device modeling to black-box settings, but has low noise tolerance making experimental demonstrations challenging. Photonic platforms offer advantages for QKD but need assessment for DIQKD feasibility.

Method: Developed efficient converging hierarchy of semi-definite programs (SDP) to bound conditional von Neumann entropy, and created finite-statistics analysis that accounts for full outcome statistics. Applied to photonic circuit identified by machine learning techniques.

Result: Analysis shows the proposed optical circuit has sufficient resistance to noise, making experimental realization of DIQKD on photonic platforms realistic.

Conclusion: Photonic DIQKD is feasible with the proposed optical circuit, addressing the challenge of low noise tolerance in DIQKD while leveraging photonic advantages for practical QKD implementation.

Abstract: Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocols enable two distant parties to communicate with information-theoretically proven secrecy. However, these protocols are generally vulnerable to potential mismatches between the physical modeling and the implementation of their quantum operations, thereby opening opportunities for side channel attacks. Device-Independent (DI) QKD addresses this problem by reducing the degree of device modeling to a black-box setting. The stronger security obtained in this way comes at the cost of a reduced noise tolerance, rendering experimental demonstrations more challenging: so far, only one experiment based on trapped ions was able to successfully generate a secret key. Photonic platforms have however long been preferred for QKD thanks to their suitability to optical fiber transmission, high repetition rates, readily available hardware, and potential for circuit integration. In this work, we assess the feasibility of DIQKD on a photonic circuit recently identified by machine learning techniques. For this, we introduce an efficient converging hierarchy of semi-definite programs (SDP) to bound the conditional von Neumann entropy and develop a finite-statistics analysis that takes into account full outcome statistics. Our analysis shows that the proposed optical circuit is sufficiently resistant to noise to make an experimental realization realistic.

### [5] [Vanishing correlations in (bi)stochastic controlled circuits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14379)
*Pavel Kos,Bruno Bertini,Tomaž Prosen*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Stochastic/bistochastic controlled gates produce spatio-temporal correlations that vanish except when operators act on the same site, with exponential decay of autocorrelations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the correlation structure in circuits composed of stochastic and bistochastic controlled gates, which arise in quantum circuits with random controlled gates, stochastic circuits, and deterministic classical cellular automata.

Method: Theoretical analysis proving that stochastic and bistochastic controlled gates lead to specific correlation patterns: two-point correlations vanish except for same-site operators, and for multi-point correlations, the two rightmost operators must act on the same site.

Result: Autocorrelation typically decays exponentially toward a value exponentially small in system size, revealing a broad class of quantum systems with surprisingly simple correlation structures despite complex microscopic dynamics.

Conclusion: Stochastic and bistochastic controlled gates exhibit highly constrained correlation patterns with vanishing spatio-temporal correlations except at coincident points, identifying a class of systems with simple emergent correlation structures.

Abstract: We study the dynamics of circuits composed of stochastic and bistochastic controlled gates. This type of dynamics arises from quantum circuits with random controlled gates, as well as in stochastic circuits and deterministic classical cellular automata. We prove that stochastic and bistochastic controlled gates lead to two-point spatio-temporal correlation functions that vanish everywhere except when the two operators act on the same site. More generally, for multi-point correlations the two rightmost operators must act on the same site. We argue that autocorrelation, while hard to compute, typically decays exponentially towards a value that is exponentially small in the system size. Our results reveal a broad class of quantum systems that exhibit surprisingly simple correlation structures despite their complex microscopic dynamics.

### [6] [Vacuum Torque Without Anisotropy: Switchable Casimir Torque Between Altermagnets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14381)
*Zixuan Dai,Qing-Dong Jiang*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Magnetic field perpendicular to 2D altermagnets generates Casimir torque via time-reversal symmetry breaking, despite preserving in-plane rotational symmetry, with quadratic field scaling and unique temperature/distance dependencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate a fundamentally different mechanism for Casimir torque generation that doesn't require explicit rotational symmetry breaking, but instead uses time-reversal symmetry breaking through magnetic fields applied to altermagnets.

Method: Focus on two-dimensional altermagnets with perpendicular magnetic field application, leveraging the combined crystalline symmetry C_n T inherent to altermagnetic order to activate orientation-dependent vacuum interactions.

Result: Magnetic field induces axially asymmetric Casimir energy and generates torque that emerges continuously, scales quadratically with field strength, and exhibits qualitatively different temperature and distance scaling behaviors compared to uniaxial bulk materials.

Conclusion: Time-reversal symmetry breaking provides a powerful route for engineering Casimir torque sign and strength, establishing altermagnets as an exciting platform for exploring vacuum quantum fluctuation phenomena.

Abstract: Casimir torque is conventionally associated with explicit breaking of rotational symmetry, arising from material dielectric anisotropy, geometric asymmetry, or externally applied fields that themselves break rotational invariance. Here we demonstrate a fundamentally different mechanism: an axially symmetric magnetic field can generate a Casimir torque by inducing an axially asymmetric Casimir energy - and can even reverse the torque's sign. Focusing on two-dimensional altermagnets, we show that a magnetic field applied perpendicular to the plane - while preserving in-plane rotational symmetry - activates an orientation-dependent vacuum interaction through the combined crystalline symmetry $\mathrm{C_n T}$ inherent to altermagnetic order. The resulting torque emerges continuously and scales quadratically with the magnetic field strength. We further analyze its temperature and distance dependence, revealing scaling behaviors that are qualitatively different from those found in uniaxial bulk materials. Our results identify time-reversal symmetry breaking as a powerful route for engineering both the sign and strength of Casimir torque and establish altermagnets as an exciting platform for exploring phenomena driven by vacuum quantum fluctuations.

*Rafael Gómez-Lurbe,Armando Pérez*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Extension of Pauli Propagation framework to simulate imaginary time evolution for computing thermal and ground-state properties with controlled accuracy-cost trade-off.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable computation of thermal and ground-state properties while retaining computational advantages of Pauli Propagation, and to create a pathway toward unified simulation of open quantum system dynamics.

Method: Derived explicit update rules for Pauli operator propagation under imaginary time evolution generated by Pauli strings, introducing imaginary time Pauli Propagation (ITPP) algorithm that approximates imaginary time dynamics directly in Pauli basis.

Result: Benchmarking on 1D transverse-field Ising model shows truncation provides controlled trade-off between accuracy and computational cost, while revealing challenges associated with operator growth under imaginary time evolution.

Conclusion: ITPP successfully extends Pauli Propagation to imaginary time, enabling thermal/ground-state property computation, and combining with real-time Pauli Propagation suggests pathway toward unified open quantum system simulation framework.

Abstract: We extend the Pauli Propagation framework to simulate imaginary time evolution. By deriving explicit update rules for the propagation of Pauli operators under imaginary time evolution generated by Pauli strings, we introduce an imaginary time Pauli Propagation (ITPP) algorithm for approximating imaginary time dynamics directly in the Pauli basis. This approach enables the computation of thermal and ground-state properties while retaining the key computational advantages of Pauli Propagation. Benchmarking ITPP on the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model demonstrates that truncation provides a controlled trade-off between accuracy and computational cost, while also revealing challenges associated with operator growth under imaginary time evolution. Finally, combining imaginary time and real-time Pauli Propagation naturally suggests a pathway toward simulating open quantum system dynamics within a unified framework.

### [8] [Quantum state exclusion with many copies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14410)
*Debanjan Roy,Tathagata Gupta,Pratik Ghosal,Samrat Sen,Somshubhro Bandyopadhyay*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Multiple identical copies enable quantum state exclusion for sets of three or more pure states, though the required number of copies can be arbitrarily large.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum state exclusion is not always possible in the single-copy setting, motivating investigation of whether access to multiple identical copies enables this task.

Method: Analyze state exclusion with multiple copies, prove that for any set of three or more pure states, exclusion becomes possible with a finite number of copies, and construct sets requiring arbitrarily large numbers of copies.

Result: State exclusion becomes possible with finite copies for sets of three or more pure states, but the required number of copies can be arbitrarily large (for every natural number N, construct sets where exclusion remains impossible with N or fewer copies).

Conclusion: Multiple copies enable state exclusion for sets of three or more pure states, but the resource requirement (number of copies) can be arbitrarily large, establishing fundamental limits on this quantum information task.

Abstract: Quantum state exclusion is the task of identifying at least one state from a known set that was not used in the preparation of a quantum system. In particular, a given set of quantum states is said to admit state exclusion if there exists a measurement such that, for each state in the set, some measurement outcome rules it out with certainty. However, state exclusion is not always possible in the single-copy setting. In this paper, we investigate whether access to multiple identical copies enables state exclusion. We prove that for any set of three or more pure states, state exclusion becomes possible with a finite number of copies. We further show that the required number of copies may be arbitrarily large -- in particular, for every natural number $N$, we construct sets of states for which exclusion remains impossible with $N$ or fewer copies.

### [9] [Quantum Super-resolution by Adaptive Non-local Observables](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14433)
*Hsin-Yi Lin,Huan-Hsin Tseng,Samuel Yen-Chi Chen,Shinjae Yoo*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: First study investigating quantum circuits for super-resolution using Variational Quantum Circuits with Adaptive Non-Local Observable measurements to achieve high-resolution reconstruction with small model size.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical deep learning methods for super-resolution require increasingly deeper networks, large datasets, and heavy computation to capture fine-grained correlations, creating a need for more efficient approaches.

Method: Proposes a framework based on Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) with Adaptive Non-Local Observable (ANO) measurements, which introduces trainable multi-qubit Hermitian observables that adapt during training, leveraging quantum system properties like entanglement and superposition.

Result: ANO-VQCs achieve up to five-fold higher resolution with relatively small model size compared to classical approaches, demonstrating quantum advantage for super-resolution tasks.

Conclusion: The study presents a promising new direction at the intersection of quantum machine learning and super-resolution, showing that quantum circuits can effectively address SR tasks with improved efficiency.

Abstract: Super-resolution (SR) seeks to reconstruct high-resolution (HR) data from low-resolution (LR) observations. Classical deep learning methods have advanced SR substantially, but require increasingly deeper networks, large datasets, and heavy computation to capture fine-grained correlations. In this work, we present the \emph{first study} to investigate quantum circuits for SR. We propose a framework based on Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) with \emph{Adaptive Non-Local Observable} (ANO) measurements. Unlike conventional VQCs with fixed Pauli readouts, ANO introduces trainable multi-qubit Hermitian observables, allowing the measurement process to adapt during training. This design leverages the high-dimensional Hilbert space of quantum systems and the representational structure provided by entanglement and superposition. Experiments demonstrate that ANO-VQCs achieve up to five-fold higher resolution with a relatively small model size, suggesting a promising new direction at the intersection of quantum machine learning and super-resolution.

*Nabi Zare Harofteh,Rafael I. Nepomechie*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Deterministic algorithm for preparing U(1)-eigenstates in spin-s chains using Gray codes and corresponding gates, applied to integrable XXX Hamiltonians.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need efficient deterministic preparation of U(1)-eigenstates (states with fixed total magnetization) in spin-s chains for quantum simulation and study of integrable systems.

Method: Exploit Gray code for bounded integer compositions to generate ditstrings with fixed digit sum; apply corresponding "Gray gates" to prepare quantum state deterministically.

Result: Algorithm enables preparation of general U(1)-eigenstates for any spin-s chain length n; successfully applied to prepare exact eigenstates of integrable spin-s XXX Hamiltonians.

Conclusion: Gray code approach provides efficient deterministic state preparation for U(1)-symmetric systems, applicable to integrable models and quantum simulation tasks.

Abstract: We formulate a deterministic algorithm for preparing a general $U(1)$-eigenstate of a spin-$s$ chain of length $n$. These states consist of linear combinations of computational basis states $|\vec{m}\rangle$ of $n$ qudits, each with $(2s+1)$ levels and $s= 1/2, 1, 3/2, \ldots$, whose ditstrings $\vec{m}$ have a fixed digit sum. Exploiting a Gray code for bounded integer compositions, whose consecutive ditstrings obey the Gray property, the quantum state is prepared by applying corresponding ``Gray gates.'' We use this algorithm to prepare exact eigenstates of integrable spin-$s$ XXX Hamiltonians.

### [11] [Active interference suppression in frequency-division-multiplexed quantum gates via off-resonant microwave tones](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14547)
*Haruki Mitarai,Yukihiro Tadokoro,Hiroya Tanaka*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Active interference suppression method for frequency-division multiplexed quantum gates that uses deliberate off-resonant microwave tones to improve gate accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing number of control lines between quantum processors and external electronics creates a major bottleneck for large-scale quantum computers. Frequency-division multiplexing could enable multiple qubit control through a single cable, but interference from off-resonant microwave tones hinders precise qubit control.

Method: Proposes an active interference suppression method for frequency-division-multiplexed simultaneous gate operations. The method deliberately incorporates off-resonant microwave tones (orthogonal or quasi-orthogonal) to improve gate accuracy. Also addresses fast oscillations neglected under the rotating wave approximation through optimized frequency allocation.

Result: Demonstrates that incorporating off-resonant microwave tones improves single-qubit gate accuracy. Gate infidelity decreases proportionally to the inverse square of the number of microwave tones. Shows that fast oscillations degrade gate fidelity, and this degradation can be mitigated through optimized frequency allocation.

Conclusion: The proposed active interference suppression method is simple yet effective for improving the performance of frequency-division-multiplexed quantum gates, addressing a key bottleneck in scaling quantum computers.

Abstract: An increase in the number of control lines between the quantum processors and the external electronics constitutes a major bottleneck in the realization of large-scale quantum computers. Frequency-division multiplexing is expected to enable multiple qubits to be controlled through a single microwave cable; however, interference from off-resonant microwave tones hinders precise qubit control. Here, we propose an active interference suppression method for frequency-division-multiplexed simultaneous gate operations. We demonstrate that deliberate incorporation of off-resonant microwave tones improves the accuracy of single-qubit gates. Specifically, we find that by incorporating off-resonant orthogonal or quasi-orthogonal microwave tones, the gate infidelity decreases proportionally to the inverse square of the number of microwave tones. Furthermore, we show that fast oscillations neglected under the rotating wave approximation degrade gate fidelity, and that this degradation can be mitigated through optimized frequency allocation. Our approach is simple yet effective for improving the performance of frequency-division-multiplexed quantum gates.

*Dylan Danese,Vatshal Srivastav,Will McCutcheon,Saroch Leedumrongwatthanakun,Mehul Malik*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Single multi-mode fiber enables programmable generalized measurements of high-dimensional photonic time-bin superpositions using spatial-temporal coupling, replacing complex cascaded interferometers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for measuring quantum superpositions of photon arrival times (time-bin states) are limited: conventional Franson-type interferometers scale poorly with dimension, require multiple cascaded devices and active stabilization, and are restricted to phase-only measurements.

Method: Utilize spatial-temporal coupling in a single multi-mode fiber by finding special spatial modes that experience distinct dispersive delays. Use the multi-spectral transmission matrix to identify these modes, then excite coherent superpositions of them to engineer equivalent large, unbalanced multi-mode interferometers inside the fiber.

Result: Demonstrated high-quality measurements of arbitrary time-bin superpositions up to dimension 11 using a single fiber as a scalable, common-path interferometer that significantly reduces experimental complexity compared to standard approaches.

Conclusion: The single fiber approach provides a scalable, common-path interferometer for time-bin qudits that dramatically eases experimental overheads, serving as an essential tool for quantum technologies leveraging temporal properties of light.

Abstract: The temporal degree-of-freedom of light is incredibly powerful for modern quantum technologies, enabling large-scale quantum computing architectures and record key-rates in quantum key distribution. However, the generalized measurement of large and complex quantum superpositions of the time-of-arrival of a photon remains a unique experimental challenge. Conventional methods based on unbalanced Franson-type interferometers scale poorly with dimension, requiring multiple cascaded devices and active phase stabilization. In addition, these are limited by construction to a restricted set of phase-only superposition measurements. Here we show how the coupling of spatial and temporal information inside a single multi-mode fiber can be harnessed to program completely generalized measurements for high-dimensional superpositions of photonic time-bin. Using the multi-spectral transmission matrix of the fiber, we find special sets of spatial modes that experience distinct dispersive delays through the fiber. By exciting coherent superpositions of these spatial modes, we engineer the equivalent of large, unbalanced multi-mode interferometers inside the fiber and use them to perform high-quality measurements of arbitrary time-bin superpositions in up to dimension 11. The single fiber functions as a scalable, common-path interferometer for time-bin qudits that significantly eases the experimental overheads of standard approaches based on unbalanced Franson-type interferometers, serving as an essential tool for quantum technologies that harness the temporal properties of light.

### [13] [Quantum Interference Needs Convention: Overlap-Determinability and Unified No-Superposition Principle](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14638)
*Jeongho Bang,Kyoungho Cho,Ki Hyuk Yee*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper establishes that probabilistic superposition of unknown pure states is possible only when the domain is "overlap-determinable" (phase conventions fix complex overlaps), and shows that universal access to such overlaps would enable quantum cloning, superluminal signaling, and collapse of Grover's lower bound.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The operational barrier in creating coherent superpositions of unknown pure states arises from the gauge freedom in phase conventions for state vectors. While quantum superposition is mathematically described as vector addition, physically only rays (rank-one projectors) are observable, leaving phase ambiguities that prevent deterministic superposition operations.

Method: The authors formalize the concept of "overlap-determinability" through phase conventions that fix complex overlaps between states. They prove a main theorem establishing exact equivalence: a nonzero completely positive trace-nonincreasing map can probabilistically produce superpositions on a domain if and only if that domain is overlap-determinable. They then analyze the computational implications of granting universal access to such convention-fixed overlaps.

Result: The main theorem unifies no-superposition results and characterizes exceptional superposition protocols that succeed when side information supplies the missing phase resource. Universal access to overlap-determinability would enable forbidden transformations (quantum cloning, superluminal signaling), reflections about unknown states, exponentially fast overlap amplification, and collapse of Grover's search lower bound to logarithmic query complexity.

Conclusion: The ability to create superpositions of unknown states is fundamentally limited by the need for phase conventions that fix complex overlaps. When such conventions are available (making domains overlap-determinable), superposition becomes possible, but universal access to this resource would destabilize foundational quantum constraints and computational complexity barriers, revealing it as a powerful but physically restricted capability.

Abstract: Quantum superposition is often phrased as the ability to add state vectors. In practice, however, the physical quantity is a ray (a rank-one projector), so each input specifies only a projector and leaves a gauge freedom in the phases of its vector representatives. This becomes a real operational barrier when one asks for a device that, given two independently prepared unknown pure states, outputs a coherent state proportional to a prescribed linear combination. We identify the missing ingredient as not probabilistic but phase-like. One needs a physical scenario that fixes a single phase convention on the relevant set of rays, so that the overlaps become well defined complex numbers. Thus, we formalize this through phase conventions and a single notion -- dubbed as "overlap-determinability." Our main theorem gives an exact equivalence: A nonzero completely positive trace-nonincreasing map that probabilistically produces superposition on a domain exists if and only if that domain is overlap-determinable. This unifies modern no-superposition results and characterizes the exceptional yes-go protocols, which succeed precisely when side information supplies the required missing resource. We then show that granting universal access to such convention-fixed overlaps destabilizes the familiar foundational and computational constraints. It enables forbidden transformations akin to quantum cloning and yields super-luminal signaling. It would also permit reflections about unknown states, leading to exponentially fast overlap amplification and a collapse of Grover's search lower bound to a logarithmic query complexity.

### [14] [Scaling Enhancement in Distributed Quantum Sensing via Causal Order Switching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14708)
*Binke Xia,Zhaotong Cui,Jingzheng Huang,Yuxiang Yang,Guihua Zeng*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A distributed quantum sensing protocol using causal-order switching achieves 1/N² precision scaling without entangled probes, experimentally demonstrated with 9 sensors for beam tilt sensing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current distributed quantum sensing schemes rely on fragile entangled probes that are difficult to scale, creating a need for more robust and practical approaches to enhance sensing performance in quantum networks.

Method: The protocol incorporates a causal-order switch into a cyclic network, allowing a single probe to sequentially query N independent sensors in coherent superposition or probabilistic mixture of opposite causal orders, exploiting noncommutativity between propagation and sensing processes.

Result: The scheme achieves 1/N²-scaling precision limit without entangled probes, experimentally implemented for distributed beam tilt sensing with up to 9 sensors, achieving picoradian-scale precision in estimating tilt angles.

Conclusion: This demonstrates a robust and scalable distributed quantum sensing protocol that surpasses conventional 1/N Heisenberg scaling, advancing practical deployment of quantum sensing networks through classical mixture of causal orders rather than quantum switches.

Abstract: Sensing networks underpin applications from fundamental physics to real-world engineering. Recently, distributed quantum sensing (DQS) has been investigated to boost the sensing performance, yet current schemes typically rely on entangled probes that are fragile to noise and difficult to scale. Here, we propose a DQS protocol that incorporates a causal-order switch into a cyclic network, enabling a single probe to sequentially query N independent sensors in a coherent superposition or a probabilistic mixture of opposite causal orders. By exploiting the noncommutativity between propagation and sensing processes, our scheme achieves a 1/N^2-scaling precision limit without involving entangled probes. Importantly, our approach utilizes a classical mixture of causal orders rather than a quantum switch, making it more feasible for practical realization. We experimentally implement this scheme for distributed beam tilts sensing in a free-space quantum optical network comprising up to 9 sensors, achieving picoradian-scale precision in estimating tilt angle.

*Tingting Li,Ziming Zhao,Jianwei Yin*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: QuFid is an adaptive, noise-aware framework that reduces measurement costs for quantum program fidelity estimation on NISQ devices by modeling circuits as DAGs and using control-flow-aware random walks to characterize noise propagation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fidelity estimation on NISQ devices is resource-intensive due to hardware noise, device heterogeneity, and transpilation-induced circuit transformations, making it difficult to predefine measurement budgets.

Method: Models quantum programs as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), employs control-flow-aware random walks to characterize noise propagation along gate dependencies, captures backend-specific effects via transpilation-induced structural deformation metrics, integrates these into random-walk formulation to create noise-propagation operator, and quantifies circuit complexity through spectral characteristics of this operator for adaptive measurement planning.

Result: Experiments on 18 quantum benchmarks executed on IBM Quantum backends show QuFid significantly reduces measurement cost compared to fixed-shot and learning-based baselines while maintaining acceptable fidelity bias.

Conclusion: QuFid provides a principled, lightweight framework for adaptive fidelity estimation that effectively addresses the challenges of NISQ device heterogeneity and noise variability.

Abstract: Fidelity estimation is a critical yet resource-intensive step in testing quantum programs on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices, where the required number of measurements is difficult to predefine due to hardware noise, device heterogeneity, and transpilation-induced circuit transformations. We present QuFid, an adaptive and noise-aware framework that determines measurement budgets online by leveraging circuit structure and runtime statistical feedback. QuFid models a quantum program as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) and employs a control-flow-aware random walk to characterize noise propagation along gate dependencies. Backend-specific effects are captured via transpilation-induced structural deformation metrics, which are integrated into the random-walk formulation to induce a noise-propagation operator. Circuit complexity is then quantified through the spectral characteristics of this operator, providing a principled and lightweight basis for adaptive measurement planning. Experiments on 18 quantum benchmarks executed on IBM Quantum backends show that QuFid significantly reduces measurement cost compared to fixed-shot and learning-based baselines, while consistently maintaining acceptable fidelity bias.

TL;DR: Distributed fan-out operations using GHZ states offer advantages over entangled pairs for distributed quantum computations in terms of circuit depth and entanglement resource reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To compare different circuit implementations for distributed quantum computations and evaluate the potential advantages of using distributed fan-out operations with GHZ states versus traditional entangled pairs.

Method: Comparative analysis of circuits implementing distributed quantum computations using two approaches: (1) entangled pairs only, and (2) distributed fan-out operations utilizing GHZ states.

Result: Distributed fan-out operations demonstrate advantages in reducing circuit depth and potentially reducing entanglement resources compared to using only entangled pairs.

Conclusion: Distributed fan-out operations (via GHZ states) could serve as a fundamental building block for distributed quantum operations, similar to entangled pairs, if efficient realization of distributed GHZ states becomes feasible.

Abstract: We compare different circuits implementing distributed versions of quantum computations, using entangled pairs only, and using distributed fan-out operations (using GHZ states). We highlight the advantages of using distributed fan-out operations in terms of reductions in circuit depth and (possibly) entanglement resources. We note that distributed fan-out operations (or notably, distributed GHZ states) could be a ``primitive'' building block for distributed quantum operations in the same way as entangled pairs are, if distributed GHZ states could be realized efficiently.

*Qinghao Wen,Zihao Ren,Lei Wang,Hyungbo Shim,Guodong Shi*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Blended dynamics theory extended to open quantum networks with diffusive couplings, revealing classical-like clustering and quantum orbit attraction behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend classical blended dynamics theory to quantum networks, which commonly arise in spontaneous emission and non-Hermitian quantum computing, to analyze emergent behaviors in heterogeneous quantum networks with diffusive couplings.

Method: Developed blended dynamics framework for open quantum networks with Hamiltonian couplings, environmental dissipation, and diffusive interactions. Extended analysis from reduced-state dynamics to qubit coherent states using quantum Laplacians and induced graphs.

Result: Showed that under strong coupling, all node trajectories stay close to blended system dynamics. Revealed classical-like clustering where qubits converge to shared equilibrium or common trajectory. Proved orbit attraction of network density operator toward quantum blended coherent dynamics.

Conclusion: Blended dynamics theory naturally extends to quantum networks, establishing emergence of both classical-like clustering and intrinsically quantum dynamically clustering behaviors, validated by numerical examples.

Abstract: In this paper, we develop a blended dynamics framework for open quantum networks with diffusive couplings. The network consists of qubits interconnected through Hamiltonian couplings, environmental dissipation, and consensus-like diffusive interactions. Such networks commonly arise in spontaneous emission processes and non-Hermitian quantum computing, and their evolution follows a Lindblad master equation. Blended dynamics theory is well established in the classical setting as a tool for analyzing emergent behaviors in heterogeneous networks with diffusive couplings. Its key insight is to blend the local dynamics rather than the trajectories of individual nodes. Perturbation analysis then shows that, under sufficiently strong coupling, all node trajectories tend to stay close to those of the blended system over time. We first show that this theory extends naturally to the reduced-state dynamics of quantum networks, revealing classical-like clustering phenomena in which qubits converge to a shared equilibrium or a common trajectory determined by the quantum blended reduced-state dynamics. We then extend the analysis to qubit coherent states using quantum Laplacians and induced graphs, proving orbit attraction of the network density operator toward the quantum blended coherent dynamics, establishing the emergence of intrinsically quantum and dynamically clustering behaviors. Finally, numerical examples validate the theoretical results.

*Toshihiro Yada,Nobuyuki Yoshioka,Takahiro Sagawa*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Pure quantum states with maximal multipartite entanglement (like Haar-random states) cannot yield extensive work under LOCC, while states with limited multipartite entanglement (like constant-degree graph states) can extract extensive work despite being locally indistinguishable from thermal states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether the equivalence between typical pure states and thermal states persists under LOCC (local operations and classical communication), where classical correlations can be exploited for work extraction, going beyond the traditional local regime where only local operations without classical communication are considered.

Method: Establish criteria for determining thermal equivalence under LOCC by analyzing the multipartite quantum correlation structure of many-body pure states. Compare different classes of states: asymptotically maximal multipartite entanglement states (Haar-random states) vs. limited multipartite entanglement states (constant-degree graph states).

Result: States with asymptotically maximal multipartite entanglement cannot yield extensive work under LOCC, while states with limited multipartite entanglement allow extensive work extraction despite being locally indistinguishable from thermal states. Thermal equivalence under LOCC is governed by multipartite quantum correlation structure.

Conclusion: The work provides a refined operational notion of thermal equivalence beyond the traditional local regime, showing that multipartite entanglement structure determines whether pure states remain equivalent to thermal states even when classical correlations can be exploited via LOCC.

Abstract: Understanding the thermal behavior of quantum many-body pure states is one of the most fundamental issues in quantum thermodynamics. It is widely known that typical pure states yield vanishing work, just as thermal states do, when one restricts to local operations that cannot access correlations among subsystems. However, it remains unclear whether this equivalence to thermal states persists under LOCC (local operations and classical communication), where classically accessible correlations can be exploited for work extraction. In this work, we establish criteria for determining whether many-body pure states remain equivalent to thermal states even under LOCC, and show that this thermal equivalence is governed by their multipartite quantum correlation structure. We show that states with asymptotically maximal multipartite entanglement, such as Haar-random states, cannot yield extensive work under LOCC, whereas some states with limited multipartite entanglement, such as constant-degree graph states, allow extensive work extraction despite being locally indistinguishable from thermal states. Thus, our work provides a refined operational notion of thermal equivalence beyond the traditional local regime, which is becoming increasingly important due to the recent expansion of experimentally accessible operations.

*Qing-Yang Qiu,Wen Huang,Lei Du,Xin-You Lü*

TL;DR: Giant atoms in 2D/3D baths enable exotic quantum dynamics, including non-Markovian beats, bound states in continuum for quantum memory, and controllable chiral emission patterns through phase engineering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore fundamental nonlocal light-matter interactions with giant atoms in high-dimensional environments, which are important for testing quantum electrodynamics beyond dipole approximation, building high-dimensional quantum networks, and engineering multipartite entangled states.

Method: Nonperturbative analysis of collective dynamics in single-excitation subspace using resolvent operator approach; study of multiple giant atoms coupled to common 2D photonic reservoir with engineered atomic arrangements; generalization to 3D baths.

Result: Engineered atomic arrangements lead to unconventional quantum dynamics: non-Markovianity-induced beats and long-lived bound states in continuum for 2D quantum memory; exotic photon emission patterns in 2D/3D baths with precisely controllable emission directions via phase engineering; survival of coherent dipole-dipole interactions in 3D baths despite continuum coupling.

Conclusion: Giant atoms in high-dimensional baths provide versatile platform for quantum memory, chiral light-matter interfaces, and challenge conventional wisdom about decoherence by demonstrating that coherent interactions can persist despite continuum coupling.

Abstract: Nonlocal light-matter interactions with giant atoms in high-dimensional environments are not only fundamentally intriguing for testing quantum electrodynamics beyond the dipole approximation but also crucial for building high-dimensional quantum networks and engineering multipartite entangled states. Given the enigmatic and largely uncharted collective signatures exhibited by multiple giant atoms within two-dimensional optical baths, we delve into their nonperturbative collective dynamics within the single-excitation subspace, focusing on the case where they are coupled to a common two-dimensional photonic reservoir and employing a resolvent operator approach. We demonstrate that precisely engineered atomic arrangements lead to unconventional quantum dynamics, featuring non-Markovianity-induced beats and long-lived bound states in the continuum, thereby providing a versatile platform for implementing two-dimensional quantum memory. Phenomenologically, we observe the emergence of exotic photon emission patterns in both two- and three-dimensional (3D) baths. The emission directions are shown to be precisely controllable on demand through exact phase engineering of the coupling parameters, enabling a highly efficient chiral light-matter interface. Moreover, our generalization to a 3D bath reveals that coherent dipole-dipole interactions can survive despite the coupling to a continuum of modes, a finding that challenges conventional wisdom regarding decoherence.

Motivation: Enable super-resolved scene characterization by simultaneously estimating multiple parameters of incoherent optical sources in the sub-Rayleigh regime, overcoming diffraction limits for comprehensive scene analysis.

Method: Spatial-mode demultiplexing (SPADE) with two demultiplexers, one deliberately shifted, to determine separations below diffraction limit and achieve joint estimation of separation, centroid, and relative brightness in a single experimental setting.

Result: Successful simultaneous estimation of three parameters characterizing incoherent optical sources in sub-Rayleigh regime, with performance benchmarked using Fisher-information-based Cramér-Rao bounds and quantum limits discussed for both realistic (slightly non-identical sources) and idealized (indistinguishable sources) scenarios.

Conclusion: SPADE with shifted demultiplexers enables comprehensive super-resolved scene characterization by simultaneously estimating multiple parameters of incoherent sources below diffraction limit, with quantum limits providing fundamental performance bounds.

Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate the simultaneous estimation of the three parameters characterizing a pair of incoherent optical sources in the sub-Rayleigh regime, enabling super-resolved scene characterization. Using spatial-mode demultiplexing (SPADE) with two demultiplexers--one deliberately shifted--we determine separations well below the diffraction limit and achieve sensitive joint estimation of separation, centroid, and relative brightness over a broad range of scene configurations in a single experimental setting. We benchmark our performance using Fisher-information-based Cramér-Rao bounds, and discuss the corresponding quantum limits. We investigate two complementary scenarios: a realistic case with slightly non-identical sources, and an idealized case of indistinguishable sources.

### [23] [Impossible Counterfactuals, Discrete Hilbert Space and Bell's Theorem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14941)
*Tim Palmer*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A locally realistic model (RaQM) violates Bell's inequality by negating Measurement Independence without denying free will, using gravitational discretization of Hilbert space and p-adic number theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide an alternative explanation for Bell inequality violations that avoids the "strange processes" historically associated with quantum mechanics (non-locality, superdeterminism, etc.) and offers a locally realistic interpretation without denying free will.

Method: Develops Rational Mechanics (RaQM) based on gravitational discretization of Hilbert space, where Hilbert states are undefined in bases with irrational squared amplitudes/complex phases. Uses p-adic number theory and distinguishes between free choice of measurement settings to nominal accuracy vs. inability to choose exact settings.

Result: Shows that violation of Bell inequalities can be understood without non-locality or other quantum strangeness. Relates RaQM to Bohm and Hiley's holistic Undivided Universe concept. Suggests that irrational bases correspond to impossible counterfactual measurements that play a key role in quantum phenomena.

Conclusion: The interpretation suggests that building more energetic particle accelerators to probe smaller scales in search of a quantum-gravity Theory of Everything may be fruitless, as the fundamental discreteness from gravitational effects already provides a locally realistic explanation of quantum phenomena.

Abstract: Negating the Measurement Independence assumption (MI) is often referred to as the `third way' to account for the experimental violation of Bell's inequality. However, this route is generally viewed as ludicrously contrived, implying some implausible conspiracy where experimenters are denied the freedom to choose measurement settings as they like. Here, a locally realistic model of quantum physics is developed (Rational Mechanics - RaQM - based on a gravitational discretisation of Hilbert Space) which violates MI without denying free will. Crucially, RaQM distinguishes experimenters' ability to freely choose measurement settings to some nominal accuracy, from an inability to choose exact settings, which were never under their control anyway. In RaQM, Hilbert states are necessarily undefined in bases where squared amplitudes and/or complex phases are irrational numbers. Such `irrational' bases correspond to conceivable but necessarily impossible counterfactual measurements, and are shown to play a ubiquitous role in the analysis of both single- and entangled-particle quantum physics. It is concluded that violation of Bell inequalities can be understood with none of the strange processes historically associated with it. Instead, using concepts from (non-classical) $p$-adic number theory, we relate RaQM to Bohm and Hiley's concept of a holistic Machian-like Undivided Universe. If this interpretation of Bell's Theorem is correct, building more and more energetic particle accelerators to probe smaller and smaller scales, in the search for a theory which synthesises quantum and gravitational physics and hence a Theory of Everything, may be a fruitless exercise.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Strong resonant drive creates Mollow triplets not just on zero-phonon line but also on phonon sidebands in vibronically coupled quantum emitters, revealing dressed states that hybridize electronic, photonic, and vibrational degrees of freedom.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Mollow triplet is traditionally observed only on the zero-phonon line of optically dressed quantum emitters. The authors investigate whether this signature can extend to phonon sidebands, which are typically considered incoherent scattering pathways, to reveal new coherence effects in vibronically coupled systems.

Method: Developed a scalable analytical formalism to model the effect in complex, multi-mode molecular systems like dibenzoterrylene. The approach predicts Mollow triplet replication on phonon sidebands under strong resonant driving conditions.

Result: Predicted that Mollow triplets are strikingly replicated on associated phonon sidebands under strong resonant drive. These "vibronic Mollow triplets" are fingerprints of dynamically generated dressed states that hybridize electronic, photonic, and vibrational degrees of freedom.

Conclusion: The work establishes precise driving conditions for observing these novel spectral features, providing a new signature of coherence in vibronically coupled systems and demonstrating that phonon sidebands can exhibit coherent behavior previously thought confined to the zero-phonon line.

Abstract: The Mollow triplet is the definitive spectral signature of an optically dressed quantum emitter. We predict that for emitters coupled to localized phonons, this signature is not confined to the zero-phonon line. Under a strong resonant drive, we show that Mollow triplets are strikingly replicated on the associated phonon sidebands -a surprising result, given that phonon sidebands are typically viewed as incoherent, inelastic scattering pathways. These vibronic Mollow triplets are a direct fingerprint of dynamically generated dressed states that hybridize the emitter's electronic, photonic, and vibrational degrees of freedom. We develop a scalable analytical formalism to model this effect in complex, multi-mode molecular systems, such as dibenzoterrylene. Our work provides the precise driving conditions for observing these novel spectral features, establishing a new signature of coherence in vibronically coupled systems.

*Robert Amelung,Hanno Sahlmann*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper analyzes multipartite entanglement in SU(2)-invariant four-valent tensors (intertwiners) using entropic fill, finding distinct entanglement distributions compared to generic tensors, with geometric dependence in coherent intertwiners.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Intertwiners represent quantum states of tetrahedra in loop quantum gravity and correspond to rotation-invariant four-party tensor states. Understanding their entanglement properties is crucial for characterizing quantum geometry and distinguishing them from generic quantum states.

Method: Numerical evaluation of entropic fill for intertwiners with equal spins ranging from 1/2 to 11, comparing generic intertwiners, coherent intertwiners, and arbitrary tensors.

Result: Entanglement distributions differ significantly: peak entanglement is highest for generic intertwiners but lowest for generic tensors, while average entanglement is highest in arbitrary tensors and lower in intertwiners for large spins. Coherent intertwiners show complex dependence on geometric data.

Conclusion: Intertwiners exhibit unique entanglement signatures distinct from generic quantum states, with implications for quantum geometry in loop quantum gravity and characterization of rotation-invariant multipartite entanglement.

Abstract: The space $\mathrm{Inv}(j_1,j_2,j_3,j_4)$ of SU(2)-invariant four-valent tensors, also known as intertwiners, can be understood as the quantum states of a tetrahedron in Euclidean space with fixed areas. In loop quantum gravity, they are states of the smallest "atom of space" with non-zero volume. At the same time they correspond to four-party tensor product states invariant under global rotations. We consider the multipartite entanglement of states in $\mathrm{Inv}(j_1,j_2,j_3,j_4)$ using the recently proposed entropic fill.
  Numerically evaluating entropic fill in the case of equal spins between $1/2$ and $11$, we find that the distributions of entanglement are very different for intertwiners as compared to generic tensors, and for coherent intertwiners as compared to generic ones. The peak in the distribution seems to be at the highest entanglement for generic intertwiners and at the lowest for generic tensors, but in terms of average entanglement, the roles are switched: average entanglement is highest in arbitrary tensors and lower in intertwiners, at least in the regime of large $j$. We also find that entanglement depends on the geometric data of coherent intertwiners in a complicated way.

Result: Model exhibits non-Markovian evolution; tunneling amplitude affects quantum coherence (measured via l₁-norm); entropy production calculated using auxiliary density operators; relationship between heat/spin currents and tunneling amplitude established.

Conclusion: Two-qubit spin-boson model in strong coupling regime shows rich non-Markovian dynamics with implications for quantum coherence control and thermal device design in non-equilibrium steady states.

Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of a two-qubit open quantum system, in particular the two-qubit spin-boson model in the strong coupling regime, coupled to two thermal bosonic baths under non-Markovian and non-equilibrium conditions. Two complementary approaches, the Hierarchical Equations of Motion (HEOM) and Reaction Coordinate Mapping (RCM), are employed to examine various coupling regimes between the qubits and their respective baths. The dynamical features of the model and the impact of the tunneling amplitude on quantum coherence of the system are probed using the $l_1$-norm of coherence. The model is further shown to have non-Markovian evolution. The nontrivial task of calculating entropy production in the strong-coupling regime is performed using auxiliary density operators in HEOM. Motivated by the realization of a quantum thermal device in the strong-coupling regime, the non-equilibrium steady-state behavior of the system is investigated. Furthermore, the relationship between the heat and spin currents and the tunneling amplitude is probed.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Physics-informed neural networks show promise for accelerating PDE solutions but aren't yet competitive with numerical solvers; quantum computing may enhance their capabilities.

Method: Developed hybrid networks combining quantum circuits with classical layers, systematically tested on various nonlinear PDEs and boundary conditions compared to purely classical networks.

Result: Quantum networks achieve accurate approximations in substantially fewer training epochs than classical networks, with greater advantage for more complex problems.

Conclusion: Quantum-enhanced hybrid networks provide basis for targeted developments to significantly accelerate numerical modeling of PDEs.

Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) form the backbone of simulations of many natural phenom- ena, for example in climate modeling, material science, and even financial markets. The application of physics-informed neural networks to accelerate the solution of PDEs is promising, but not compet- itive with numerical solvers yet. Here, we show how quantum computing can improve the ability of physics-informed neural networks to solve partial differential equations. For this, we develop hybrid networks consisting of quantum circuits combined with classical layers and systematically test them on various non linear PDEs and boundary conditions in comparison with purely classical networks. We demonstrate that the advantage of using quantum networks lies in their ability to achieve an accurate approximation of the solution in substantially fewer training epochs, particularly for more complex problems. These findings provide the basis for targeted developments of hybrid quantum neural networks with the goal to significantly accelerate numerical modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Superconducting qubit networks in resonators enable collective quantum dynamics and enhanced microwave photon detection sensitivity. The quantum ac Stark effect from qubit-photon coupling creates strong nonlinear photon interactions that need experimental investigation.

Method: Two-tone spectroscopy experiment with 10 superconducting flux qubits coupled to input resonator and output transmission line. External microwave pump near resonance populates resonator mode as Bose-Einstein condensate, while probe beam scans Bogoliubov-like excitations.

Result: Transmission coefficient |S21(f)| shows abrupt change in resonant dip position when pump power exceeds critical value Pcr. Sharp shift occurs in narrow pump frequency region and can be tuned by applied magnetic field, indicating photon number bistability inside resonator.

Conclusion: The observed bistability signature confirms theoretical predictions of nonlinear photon interactions in superconducting qubit networks, demonstrating tunable quantum effects with potential applications in quantum sensing and information processing.

Abstract: Superconducting qubit networks (SQNs) embedded in a low-dissipative resonator is a promising device allowing one not only to establish the collective quantum dynamics on a macroscopic scale but also to greatly enhance the sensitivity of detectors of microwave photons. A quantum ac Stark effect provided by coupling between an SQN and microwave photons of a resonator, leads to a strong nonlinear interaction between photons. Here, we present a two-tone spectroscopy experiment in which a set of 10 superconducting flux qubits is coupled to the input R- resonator and the output T- transmission line. An external microwave pump field close to the resonance frequency populates macroscopically the resonator mode as a Bose-Einstein condensate, while a second probe beam scans the resonances referred also as Bogoliubov-like excitations. The corresponding excitation frequency measured from the transmission coefficient, |S21(f)| displays an abrupt change of the resonant dip position once the power of the pump field overcomes a critical value Pcr. This sharp shift occurs in a narrow region of pump frequencies, and can be tuned by an applied magnetic field. It is a signature of bistability of the photon number inside the resonator, in agreement with theory.

TL;DR: Characterization of entanglement summoning tasks with conditions for success given limited communication resources and causal constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand when distributed parties can successfully prepare entanglement between distant locations under timing constraints and restricted quantum network communication links.

Method: Building on earlier work, analyzing entanglement summoning tasks with bidirected causal connections and developing sufficient conditions for general cases with both oriented and bidirected connections, using recent entanglement sharing schemes.

Result: Provides necessary and sufficient condition for entanglement summoning tasks with only bidirected causal connections, and sufficient conditions for the most general case containing both oriented and bidirected causal connections.

Conclusion: Advances characterization of entanglement summoning by establishing precise conditions for success under various communication constraints, leveraging entanglement sharing schemes.

Abstract: In an entanglement summoning task, a set of distributed, co-operating parties attempt to fulfill requests to prepare entanglement between distant locations. The parties share limited communication resources: timing constraints may require the entangled state be prepared before some pairs of distant parties can communicate, and a restricted set of links in a quantum network may further constrain communication. Building on earlier work, we continue the characterization of entanglement summoning. We give an if and only if condition on entanglement summoning tasks with only bidirected causal connections, and provide a set of sufficient conditions addressing the most general case containing both oriented and bidirected causal connections. Our results rely on the recent development of entanglement sharing schemes.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Improved DQI algorithm achieves nearly linear-time solution for OPI problem by sidestepping quadratic Dicke state preparation, matching independent concurrent work.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Jordan et al.'s DQI algorithm for OPI has quadratic-time bottleneck from Dicke state preparation; improvements needed for practical efficiency.

Method: Proposed several improvements to DQI algorithm, including techniques to sidestepping quadratic-time Dicke state preparation, leveraging random access to input.

Result: Achieved nearly linear-time DQI algorithm for OPI problem, matching independent concurrent work by Khattar et al. using different techniques.

Conclusion: DQI algorithms can be optimized to near-linear time for OPI, making them more practical while maintaining quantum advantage over classical polynomial-time algorithms.

Abstract: Recently, Jordan et al. (Nature, 2025) introduced a novel quantum-algorithmic technique called Decoded Quantum Interferometry (DQI) for solving specific combinatorial optimization problems associated with classical codes. They presented a constraint-satisfaction problem called Optimal Polynomial Intersection (OPI) and showed that, for this problem, a DQI algorithm running in polynomial time can satisfy a larger fraction of constraints than any known polynomial-time classical algorithm.
  In this work, we propose several improvements to the DQI algorithm, including sidestepping the quadratic-time Dicke state preparation. Given random access to the input, we show how these improvements result in a nearly linear-time DQI algorithm for the OPI problem. Concurrently and independently with this work, Khattar et al. (arXiv:2510:10967) also construct a nearly linear-time DQI algorithm for OPI using slightly different techniques.

TL;DR: Mid-infrared electroluminescent devices using metamaterial nano-emitter arrays in microcavities with patch antennas achieve 100× power enhancement and collimated emission by engineering photonic environments to boost spontaneous emission rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mid- and far-infrared wavelengths lack efficient luminescent devices because spontaneous emission rates are much slower than nonradiative relaxation processes, forcing reliance on stimulated emission through optical gain. Spontaneous emission is not an intrinsic emitter property but can be modified by photonic environment engineering.

Method: Engineered metamaterials composed of arrays of nano-emitters integrated into microcavities coupled to patch antennas. This approach reshapes the photonic environment around emitting dipoles to enhance spontaneous emission rates via Purcell effect principles.

Result: Demonstrated mid-infrared electroluminescent devices emitting collimated beams with excellent spatial properties. Achieved 100× increase in collected power compared to standard devices. Devices operate close to thermodynamic equilibrium similar to visible-range LEDs.

Conclusion: By engineering photonic environments around emitting dipoles, spontaneous emission can be enhanced to create efficient optoelectronic light-emitting devices in mid-infrared range, operating similarly to visible LEDs rather than relying on stimulated emission mechanisms.

Abstract: Efficient generation of radiation in the mid- and far- infrared relies primarily on lasers and coherent nonlinear optical phenomena driven by lasers. This wavelength range lacks of luminescent devices because the spontaneous emission rate becomes much longer than the nonradiative energy relaxation processes and therefore emitters have to count on stimulated emission produced by linear or non-linear optical gain. However, spontaneous emission is not a fundamental property of the emitter. By engineering metamaterials composed of arrays of nano-emitters into microcavities coupled to patch antennas, we have demonstrated mid-infrared electroluminescent devices emitting a collimated beam with excellent spatial properties and a factor 100 increase in the collected power, compared to standard devices. Our results illustrate that by reshaping the photonic environment around emitting dipoles, as in the Purcell effect, it is possible to enhance the spontaneous emission and conceive efficient optoelectronic light emitting devices that operate close to the thermodynamical equilibrium as LEDs in the visible range.

### [34] [Precision Enhancement in Transient Quantum Thermometry:Cold-Probe Bias and Its Removal](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15237)
*Debarupa Saha,Ujjwal Sen*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Transient quantum thermometry shows temperature bias: Markovian dynamics requires initially cold probes for enhanced precision, while non-Markovian dynamics allows both hot and cold probes to achieve same high precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate temperature bias in transient quantum thermometry and understand how Markovian vs non-Markovian dynamics affects precision limits in temperature estimation using qubit probes.

Method: Analyze qubit thermometers under Markovian and non-Markovian dynamics, examining precision bounds for temperature estimation during transient evolution compared to steady-state limits.

Result: Markovian dynamics shows temperature bias: enhanced precision beyond steady state only achievable with initially cold probes. Non-Markovian dynamics lifts this bias, allowing both hot and cold probes to reach same transient maximum precision above steady-state value.

Conclusion: The nature of probe dynamics (Markovian vs non-Markovian) fundamentally affects temperature bias in quantum thermometry, with non-Markovianity enabling unbiased high-precision temperature estimation regardless of initial probe temperature.

Abstract: We unveil a temperature bias of the probe in transient quantum thermometry under Markovian dynamics. Specifically, for qubit thermometers evolving under Markovian dynamics, we show that enhanced precision beyond the steady state limit can be achieved if and only if the probe is initially colder than the thermal state corresponding to the bath temperature to be estimated. In contrast, this temperature bias can be lifted when the probe dynamics is non-Markovian. In the non-Markovian regime, both hot and cold probes can simultaneously attain the same transient maximum precision, well above the steady-state value.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The field lacks integrated infrastructure connecting classical electronic structure calculations to quantum circuit execution, despite mature quantum algorithms for chemistry. Existing solutions are fragmented, hindering workflow composition and reproducibility.

Method: A modular architecture separates data representations from computational methods, allowing workflow composition from interchangeable components. The toolkit includes native algorithm implementations and integrates with open-source quantum chemistry packages and quantum computing frameworks via a plugin system.

Result: QDK/Chemistry provides the missing infrastructure layer, enabling researchers to combine methods from different sources without modifying workflow logic, thereby facilitating reproducible quantum chemistry experiments.

Conclusion: The toolkit serves as a foundational platform for quantum chemistry workflows, addressing fragmentation in the field and supporting the development of reproducible experiments through its modular, plugin-based design.

Abstract: We present QDK/Chemistry, a software toolkit for quantum chemistry workflows targeting quantum computers. The toolkit addresses a key challenge in the field: while quantum algorithms for chemistry have matured considerably, the infrastructure connecting classical electronic structure calculations to quantum circuit execution remains fragmented. QDK/Chemistry provides this infrastructure through a modular architecture that separates data representations from computational methods, enabling researchers to compose workflows from interchangeable components. In addition to providing native implementations of targeted algorithms in the quantum-classical pipeline, the toolkit builds upon and integrates with widely used open-source quantum chemistry packages and quantum computing frameworks through a plugin system, allowing users to combine methods from different sources without modifying workflow logic. This paper describes the design philosophy, current capabilities, and role of QDK/Chemistry as a foundation for reproducible quantum chemistry experiments.

### [36] [Superluminal Transformations and Indeterminism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15263)
*Amrapali Sen,Flavio Del Santo*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Superluminal transformations (SpTs) and finite information cannot coexist; any theory with SpTs requires unbounded information, leading to deterministic ontology unlike quantum indeterminism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the relationship between superluminal transformations (SpTs) in relativity and indeterminism, addressing claims that SpTs entail quantum-like indeterminism, and to clarify whether such indeterminism is genuinely quantum or classical in nature.

Method: Derives a no-go theorem from natural assumptions, demonstrating an incompatibility between superluminal transformations and finite information content, analyzing the implications for determinism and information theory.

Result: Proves that superluminal transformations and finite information cannot coexist; any theory accommodating SpTs must allow unbounded information content, resulting in deterministic ontology similar to classical theories over real numbers.

Conclusion: The apparent indeterminism from superluminal transformations reflects only subjective ignorance probabilities, not objective quantum probabilities, indicating that claimed indeterminacy from superluminal extensions is not genuinely quantum.

Abstract: Quantum theory is widely regarded as fundamentally indeterministic, yet classical frameworks can also exhibit indeterminism once infinite information is abandoned. At the same time, relativity is usually taken to forbid superluminal signalling, yet Lorentz symmetry formally admits superluminal transformations (SpTs). Dragan and Ekert have argued that SpTs entail indeterminism analogous to the quantum one. Here, we derive a no-go theorem from natural assumptions, which can be interpreted as: superluminal transformations (SpTs) and finite information cannot coexist. Any theory accommodating SpTs must therefore allow unbounded information content, leading to a deterministic ontology akin to that of classical theories formulated over the real numbers. Thus, any apparent indeterminism arising from superluminal transformations reflects only probabilities arising from subjective ignorance, unlike the objective nature of probabilities in quantum theory, indicating that the claimed indeterminacy from superluminal extensions is not quantum.
