We show the answer is affirmative for 1D systems, while higher dimensional extensions and topologically ordered systems require further work. While Gioia and Wang's result applies to states connected via finite depth quantum circuits to a translation symmetric state, it is often impractical to find such a circuit to determine the nature of the entanglement of states that break translation symmetry. Here, instead of translation eigenstates, we focus on the many-body momentum distribution and the expectation value of the translation operator in many-body states of systems having broken translation symmetry. We show that in the continuum limit the magnitude of the expectation value of the translation operator $|<T>|$ necessarily goes to $1$ for delocalized states, a proxy for LRE states in 1D systems.

To that end, we introduce two models: a deterministic version of the random dimer model, illustrating the role of the thermodynamic and continuum limits for our result at a lattice level, and a simplified version of the Aubry-Andre model, with commensurate hopping for both momentum and position space.

These HMMs are often large, with high-dimensional memories. A recently-proposed application of quantum technologies is to execute quantum analogues of HMMs. Such quantum HMMs (QHMMs) are strictly more expressive than their classical counterparts, enabling the construction of more parsimonious models of stochastic processes. However, state-of-the-art techniques for QHMM compression, based on tensor networks, are only applicable for a restricted subset of HMMs, where the transitions are deterministic. In this work we introduce a pipeline by which \\emph{any} finite, ergodic HMM can be compressed in this manner, providing a route for effective quantum dimension reduction of general HMMs. We demonstrate the method on both a simple toy model, and on a speech-derived HMM trained from data, obtaining favourable memory--accuracy trade-offs compared to classical compression approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "Quantum HMM compression pipeline enables dimension reduction for any finite ergodic HMM, outperforming classical approaches in memory-accuracy trade-offs.", "motivation": "Classical HMMs are large and high-dimensional, while existing quantum HMM compression techniques are limited to deterministic transition HMMs, creating a need for general compression methods.", "method": "Developed a pipeline that compresses any finite, ergodic HMM using quantum dimension reduction techniques, demonstrated on toy models and speech-derived HMMs.", "result": "The method achieves favorable memory-accuracy trade-offs compared to classical compression approaches, enabling effective quantum dimension reduction for general HMMs.", "conclusion": "The proposed pipeline successfully extends quantum HMM compression to arbitrary finite ergodic HMMs, providing a practical route for quantum dimension reduction with superior performance over classical methods."}}
