*Yue Heng Liu,Zi-Xiang Hu,Qi Li*

Main category: cond-mat.dis-nn

TL;DR: Complex NNN hoppings in Lieb lattice reveal interplay between flat-band localization, topological edge states, and disorder-induced inverse Anderson transitions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how complex next-nearest-neighbor hoppings affect flat-band localization mechanisms and topological properties in 2D Lieb lattices, particularly the interplay between geometric localization, topological edge states, and disorder effects.

Method: Transfer matrix method applied to study flat-band localization with complex NNN hoppings; analysis of topological edge states under weak disorder; investigation of correlated disorders inducing inverse Anderson transitions; Chern number calculations to confirm robustness.

Result: Geometric localization in flat bands can be alleviated by topological edge states under weak disorder; correlated disorders induce inverse Anderson transitions with topological edge states persisting under strong disorder; Chern number calculations confirm robustness and identify root cause.

Conclusion: The findings establish a unified platform for investigating topological phase transitions, flat bands, and disorder effects in Lieb lattices with complex hoppings, revealing important connections between geometric localization, topological protection, and disorder-induced phenomena.

Abstract: For two-dimensional Lieb lattice, while intrinsic spin-orbit coupling is responsible for opening the gap that exhibits the quantum spin Hall effect, topological phase transitions are driven by a real next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) hopping. In this work, we utilize the transfer matrix method to study the flat-band localization mechanism in the presence of complex NNN hoppings. We demonstrate that the geometric localization in flat bands can be alleviated by topological edge states under weak disorder. Furthermore, correlated disorders are shown to induce inverse Anderson transition with the topological edge states persisting under strong disorder, a robustness confirmed by Chern number calculations, which identifies the root cause of this phenomenon. These findings establish a unified platform for investigating topological phase transitions, flat bands, and disorder effects.

### [2] [Exponential gain in clock precision using quantum correlated ticks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10785)
*Florian Meier,Yuri Minoguchi,Gianmichele Blasi,Géraldine Haack,Marcus Huber*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Quantum clock design using autonomous self-correction via quantum correlations achieves exponential precision advantage at ultra-short timescales through emergent Pauli exclusion principle.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing clock technologies face fundamental precision limits at ultra-short timescales - traditional oscillators lack short-term precision, while stochastic tick approaches have inherent limitations. There's a need for new paradigms that can operate with high precision at ultra-short timescales.

Method: Proposes autonomous self-correction of consecutive ticks using quantum correlations, integrating insights from quantum transport theory. Fully solves a model of coupled quantum systems where emergent Pauli exclusion principle correlates the clock at quantum level.

Result: Demonstrates exponential advantage in precision through quantum correlations. Simulations with realistic imperfections show the remarkable gain in precision remains stable, providing a roadmap for implementation with contemporary quantum technologies.

Conclusion: Quantum correlation-based autonomous self-correction provides a viable new paradigm for ultra-short timescale clocks with exponential precision advantages, overcoming fundamental limitations of existing approaches.

Abstract: Creating precise timing devices at ultra-short time scales is not just an important technological challenge, but confronts us with foundational questions about timekeeping's ultimate precision limits. Research on clocks has either focused on long-term stability using an oscillator stabilized by a level transition, limiting precision at short timescales, or on making individual stochastic ticks as precise as possible. Here, we prove the viability of a conceptually different avenue: the autonomous self-correction of consecutive ticks by quantum correlations. This provides a new paradigm that integrates the advantages and insights from quantum transport theory to operate clocks at ultra-short timescales. We fully solve a model of coupled quantum systems and show how the emergent Pauli exclusion principle correlates the clock at the quantum level yielding an exponential advantage in precision. We furthermore demonstrate through simulations with realistic imperfections that this remarkable gain in precision remains stable providing a roadmap for implementation with contemporary quantum technologies.

### [3] [Elevator Codes: Concatenation for resource-efficient quantum memory under biased noise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10786)
*Peter Shanahan,Diego Ruiz*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A new 2D local code construction using concatenated classical codes reduces qubit overhead by over 50% for highly biased noise (η ≥ 7×10⁴), outperforming rectangular surface and XZZX codes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Biased-noise qubits suppress certain error types (X/Y) more than others (Z), reducing quantum error correction overhead. Existing codes like rectangular surface code (low threshold) and XZZX code (doubles qubit count) have limitations that need addressing.

Method: Concatenation of two classical codes: inner repetition phase-flip codes handle phase errors with high threshold, outer high-rate bit-flip codes handle residual bit-flip errors efficiently at logical level, circumventing device connectivity constraints.

Result: Over 50% reduction in qubit overhead at p_Z=10⁻³ and η=2×10⁶ to achieve logical error rate of 10⁻¹². Code outperforms existing approaches for noise biases η ≥ 7×10⁴.

Conclusion: For sufficiently biased noise, addressing phase-flip and bit-flip errors at different coding layers is optimal: inner code prioritizes high threshold for phase errors, outer code optimizes encoding rate efficiency for bit-flip errors.

Abstract: Biased-noise qubits, in which one type of error (e.g. $X$- and $Y$-type errors) is significantly suppressed relative to the other (e.g. $Z$-type errors), can significantly reduce the overhead of quantum error correction. Codes such as the rectangular surface code or XZZX code substantially reduce the qubit overhead under biased noise, but they still face challenges. The rectangular surface code suffers from a relatively low threshold, while the XZZX code requires twice as many physical qubits to maintain the same code distance as the surface code. In this work, we introduce a 2D local code construction that outperforms these codes for noise biases $η\ge 7\times10^{4}$, reducing the qubit overhead by over 50% at $p_Z=10^{-3}$ and $η= 2 \times 10^6$ to achieve a logical error rate of $10^{-12}$. Our construction relies on the concatenation of two classical codes. The inner codes are repetition phase-flip codes while the outer codes are high-rate bit-flip codes enabled by their implementation at the logical level, which circumvents device connectivity constraints. These results indicate that under sufficiently biased noise, it is advantageous to address phase-flip and bit-flip errors at different layers of the coding scheme. The inner code should prioritize a high threshold for phase-flip errors, while the bit-flip outer code should optimize for encoding rate efficiency. In the strong biased-noise regime, high-rate outer codes keep the overhead for correcting residual bit-flip errors comparable to that of the repetition code itself, meaningfully lower than that required by earlier approaches.

### [4] [Critical non-equilibrium phases from noisy topological memories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10792)
*Amir-Reza Negari,Subhayan Sahu,Jan Behrends,Benjamin Béri,Timothy H. Hsieh*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Extended non-equilibrium critical phase exists in surface code under heralded Pauli measurements, characterized by sub-exponential CMI decay, mapped to completely packed loop model's Goldstone phase, with polylogarithmic CMI decay and partial logical information recoverable only by global decoders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate quantum error correction properties of surface codes under non-equilibrium dynamics induced by heralded random Pauli measurements, and understand the nature of information retention and decodability in resulting mixed states.

Method: Map the mixed state of surface code under heralded random Pauli measurements to ensemble of completely packed loops on square lattice, relate to Goldstone phase of loop model, analyze conditional mutual information (CMI) decay using characteristic loop length scales, and introduce punctured coherent information diagnostic for decoder analysis.

Result: Discovery of extended non-equilibrium critical phase with sub-exponential (polylogarithmic) CMI decay, where partial logical information persists but is only recoverable by global decoders, not by any quasi-local decoders, as demonstrated by punctured coherent information diagnostic.

Conclusion: Surface codes under heralded Pauli measurements exhibit a critical phase with unique information retention properties, where logical information is partially preserved but requires global decoding strategies, establishing fundamental limitations on quasi-local error correction in non-equilibrium quantum systems.

Abstract: We demonstrate the existence of an extended non-equilibrium critical phase, characterized by sub-exponential decay of conditional mutual information (CMI), in the surface code subject to heralded random Pauli measurement channels. By mapping the resulting mixed state to the ensemble of completely packed loops on a square lattice, we relate the extended phase to the Goldstone phase of the loop model. In particular, CMI is controlled by the characteristic length scale of loops, and we use analytic results of the latter to establish polylogarithmic decay of CMI in the critical phase. We find that the critical phase retains partial logical information that can be recovered by a global decoder, but not by any quasi-local decoder. To demonstrate this, we introduce a diagnostic called punctured coherent information which provides a necessary condition for quasi-local decoding.

### [5] [Parent Hamiltonians for stabilizer quantum many-body scars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10805)
*Shane Dooley*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A general construction method for embedding stabilizer states as quantum many-body scars in local Hamiltonians using factorizable Pauli strings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum many-body scars (QMBS) represent weak ergodicity breaking in many-body systems, and there's a need for systematic methods to construct such states in local Hamiltonians.

Method: Uses factorizability of Pauli strings on lattices to convert stabilizer elements into local, few-body operators that annihilate stabilizer states, enabling systematic construction of parent Hamiltonians with zero-energy stabilizer QMBS.

Result: The method reproduces known results (rainbow QMBS, entangled antipodal Bell pair) and constructs new examples including cluster states, toric code states, and volume-law entangled antipodal toric code states, confirmed by exact diagonalization.

Conclusion: Provides a unified framework for constructing stabilizer states as QMBS in local Hamiltonians, enabling systematic exploration of complex entanglement structures in weakly ergodicity-breaking systems.

Abstract: Quantum many-body scars (QMBS) have attracted considerable interest due to their role in weak ergodicity breaking in many-body systems. We present a general construction that embeds stabilizer states as QMBS of local Hamiltonians. The method relies on a notion of factorizability of Pauli strings on a lattice, which is used to convert stabilizer elements into local, few-body operators that annihilate the stabilizer state. This enables the systematic construction of parent Hamiltonians with zero-energy stabilizer QMBS typically near the middle of the spectrum. The method reproduces several known results in a unified framework, including recent examples of volume-law entangled QMBS, such as the ``rainbow'' QMBS and the entangled antipodal Bell pair state. We also apply the framework to construct examples of stabilizer QMBS with a more complex entanglement structure, such as the cluster state, the toric code state, and a volume-law entangled state we dub the antipodal toric code (ATC) state. Exact diagonalization confirms our results and reveal the stabilizer states as exact eigenstates of their parent Hamiltonian.

### [6] [Charging a quantum battery from the Bloch sphere](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10844)
*C. A. Downing,M. S. Ukhtary*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Analytical study of quantum battery charging using two qubits (charger+battery) reveals how initial quantum state affects energy storage, ergotropy, and capacity, with quantum coherences and population inversions playing key roles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the quantum energetics and thermodynamics of charging processes in simple quantum battery models, particularly how initial quantum states affect energy storage capabilities and thermodynamic properties beyond standard approaches.

Method: Theoretical analysis of a two-component quantum battery model consisting of a charger qubit and a single-cell battery qubit. The study allows the initial quantum state of the charger to vary across the Bloch sphere surface and derives generalized analytical expressions for stored energy, ergotropy, and capacity.

Result: Found that stored energy, ergotropy, and capacity all depend on the initial Bloch sphere polar angle in patterns reminiscent of the quantum area theorem. Identified that ergotropy production and battery capacity originate from quantum coherences and population inversions, with their balance depending on the starting polar angle. Discovered that ergotropic charging power and optimal charging time deviate significantly from standard results that ignore thermodynamic considerations.

Conclusion: The theoretical framework provides important insights into quantum battery charging mechanisms, highlighting the crucial roles of quantum coherences and population inversions. This groundwork can guide future experiments in quantum energy science using coupled two-level systems, offering a more complete thermodynamic understanding of quantum battery performance.

Abstract: We reconsider the quantum energetics and quantum thermodynamics of the charging process of a simple, two-component quantum battery model made up of a charger qubit and a single--cell battery qubit. We allow for the initial quantum state of the charger to lie anywhere on the surface of the Bloch sphere, and find the generalized analytical expressions describing the stored energy, ergotropy and capacity of the battery, all of which depend upon the initial Bloch sphere polar angle in a manner evocative of the quantum area theorem. The origin of the ergotropy produced, as well as the genesis of the battery capacity, can be readily traced back to the quantum coherences and population inversions generated (and the balance between these two mechanisms is contingent upon the starting Bloch polar angle). Importantly, the ergotropic charging power and its associated optimal charging time display notable deviations from standard results which disregard thermodynamic considerations. Our theoretical groundwork may be useful for guiding forthcoming experiments in quantum energy science based upon coupled two-level systems.

### [7] [Efficient Quantum Circuits for the Hilbert Transform](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10876)
*Henry Zhang,Joseph Li*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Quantum algorithm for discrete Hilbert transform with polylogarithmic size and logarithmic depth, exponentially faster than classical methods, applicable to non-stationary signal analysis and anomaly detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Hilbert transform is crucial for analyzing non-stationary signals and anomaly detection, but no efficient quantum implementations existed despite quantum Fourier and wavelet transforms being well-established. Classical Hilbert transform algorithms require O(N) operations, creating a need for quantum speedup.

Method: Novel quantum circuit construction implementing discrete Hilbert transform with polylogarithmic size and logarithmic depth for length N signals. The algorithm is generalized to d-dimensional Hilbert transforms with depth O(d log N), using quantum circuit design principles.

Result: Achieves exponential reduction in operations compared to classical algorithms (O(N) vs polylog(N)). Simulations confirm exact agreement with classical results for power systems control and image processing applications, demonstrating practical effectiveness.

Conclusion: First efficient quantum implementation of Hilbert transform fills a gap in quantum signal processing toolkit, enabling quantum advantage for non-stationary signal analysis and anomaly detection tasks with exponential speedup over classical methods.

Abstract: The quantum Fourier transform and quantum wavelet transform have been cornerstones of quantum information processing. However, for non-stationary signals and anomaly detection, the Hilbert transform can be a more powerful tool, yet no prior work has provided efficient quantum implementations for the discrete Hilbert transform. This letter presents a novel construction for a quantum Hilbert transform in polylogarithmic size and logarithmic depth for a signal of length $N$, exponentially fewer operations than classical algorithms for the same mapping. We generalize this algorithm to create any $d$-dimensional Hilbert transform in depth $O(d\log N)$. Simulations demonstrate effectiveness for tasks such as power systems control and image processing, with exact agreement with classical results.

*Shaojiang Zhu,Xinyuan You,Alexander Romanenko,Anna Grassellino*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A two-tooth bosonic quantum comb enables multi-time coherence transport analysis between thermal absorber and coherent probe, allowing bosonic noise spectroscopy that distinguishes Markovian temperature noise from structured fluctuations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a method for probing fluctuating bosonic environments that captures both instantaneous fluctuations and their temporal correlations, enabling discrimination between different types of noise in quantum systems.

Method: Introduces a two-tooth bosonic quantum comb that captures sequential interactions between thermal absorber and long-lived coherent probe. Uses process-tensor formulation to derive closed-form expressions for coherence transport, with interference between interaction windows generating non-monotonic memory response.

Result: The probe directly samples the absorber's population correlator by sweeping temporal separation between interaction windows, enabling bosonic noise spectroscopy that discriminates Markovian temperature noise from slow or spectrally structured fluctuations.

Conclusion: The approach provides a general method for probing fluctuating bosonic environments, is compatible with circuit-QED platforms, and offers causal multi-time description of coherence transport with applications in quantum noise spectroscopy.

Abstract: We introduce a two-tooth bosonic quantum comb that captures the sequential interactions between a thermal absorber and a long-lived coherent probe. The comb provides a causal, multi-time description of coherence transport, tracking how the probe records both instantaneous fluctuations and their temporal correlations. Using a process-tensor formulation, we derive closed form expressions showing that interference between the two interaction windows generates a non-monotonic memory response that reflects a fundamental competition between the absorbers thermal population and its dynamical correlations. By sweeping the temporal separation between the interaction windows, the probe directly samples the absorbers population correlator, enabling bosonic noise spectroscopy that discriminates Markovian temperature noise from slow or spectrally structured fluctuations. The approach is readily compatible with circuit-QED platforms and offers a general method for probing fluctuating bosonic environments.

### [9] [Quantum trajectories for time-binned data and their closeness to fully conditioned quantum trajectories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10937)
*Nattaphong Wonglakhon,Areeya Chantasri,Howard M. Wiseman*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper analyzes finite-interval dynamical maps for quantum trajectories with binned measurement data, showing that while average-current conditioning yields nearly pure states, their distance from true conditioned states scales poorly; introducing a Φ-map with one additional statistic achieves better scaling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is renewed interest in dynamical maps for quantum trajectories with finite time intervals, particularly for experimentally relevant cases where only average current over intervals is available. The authors aim to address the limitations of existing finite-interval maps and improve accuracy in reconstructing true conditioned quantum states.

Method: The authors analyze the scaling properties of different finite-interval dynamical maps: 1) the average-current map (ρ_faucet), 2) a new Φ-map requiring one additional real statistic φ_t of the current, 3) the lowest-order (Itô) map, and 4) two other higher-order maps. They derive analytical scaling results for the distance between conditioned states from these maps and the true states conditioned on full current, and verify these scalings numerically.

Result: The average-current map produces states with impurity scaling as (Δt)³, but the typical distance from true conditioned states scales as (Δt)^{3/2}. The new Φ-map, requiring only one additional statistic φ_t, yields states with distance scaling as (Δt)² from the true conditioned states. Numerical verification confirms these scaling laws, showing the Φ-map provides smaller error than any other map when φ_t can be extracted experimentally.

Conclusion: For generic quantum systems, if the additional statistic φ_t can be extracted from experiment along with the average current I_t, the Φ-map provides superior accuracy in reconstructing conditioned quantum states compared to other finite-interval dynamical maps, offering a practical improvement for experimental quantum trajectory analysis.

Abstract: Quantum trajectories are dynamical equations for quantum states conditioned on the results of a time-continuous measurement, such as a continuous-in-time current $\vec y_t$. Recently there has been renewed interest in dynamical maps for quantum trajectories with time-intervals of finite size $Δt$. Guilmin \emph{et al.} (unpublished) derived such a dynamical map for the (experimentally relevant) case where only the average current $I_t$ over each interval is available. Surprisingly, this binned data still generates a conditioned state $ρ_\text{\faFaucet}$ that is almost pure (for efficient measurements), with an impurity scaling as $(Δt)^{3}$. We show that, nevertheless, the typical distance of $ρ_\text{\faFaucet}$ from $\hatψ_{\text{F}; \vec y_t}$ -- the projector for the pure state conditioned on the full current -- is as large as $(Δt)^{3/2}$. We introduce another finite-interval dynamical map (``$Φ$-map''), which requires only one additional real statistic, $φ_t$, of the current in the interval, that gives a conditioned state $\hatψ_Φ$ which is only $(Δt)^{2}$-distant from $\hatψ_{\text{F}; \vec y_t}$. We numerically verify these scalings of the error (distance from the true states) for these two maps, as well as for the lowest-order (Itô) map and two other higher-order maps. Our results show that, for a generic system, if the statistic $φ_t$ can be extracted from experiment along with $I_t$, then the $Φ$-map gives a smaller error than any other.

### [10] [The Hilbert-Schmidt norms of quantum channels and matrix integrals over the unit sphere](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10943)
*Yuan Li,Zhengli Chen,Zhihua Guo,Yongfeng Pang*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Analysis of quantum channel norms, characterization of extremal values for $\|\mathcal{E}\|_2^2+\|\widetilde{\mathcal{E}}\|_2^2$, description of CP maps preserving pure states, and extensions of matrix integrals over unit spheres.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the range of possible values for the sum of squared Hilbert-Schmidt norms of quantum channels and their complementary channels, characterize extremal channels, describe completely positive maps preserving pure states in infinite dimensions, and extend matrix integral results over unit spheres.

Method: Mathematical analysis of quantum channels using Hilbert-Schmidt norms, complementary channel theory, operator algebra techniques for infinite-dimensional systems, and matrix integration methods over unit spheres with extensions to various matrix integrals.

Result: Determined the range of $\|\mathcal{E}\|_2^2+\|\widetilde{\mathcal{E}}\|_2^2$ for quantum channels, provided equivalent characterizations for channels achieving maximum/minimum values, obtained concrete description of CP maps preserving pure states in infinite dimensions, demonstrated equivalency of several matrix integrals over unit spheres, and extended these matrix integrals.

Conclusion: The paper establishes fundamental results about quantum channel norms, characterizes extremal channels, provides insights into pure state preserving maps in infinite dimensions, and advances matrix integration theory with applications to quantum information theory.

Abstract: The dynamics of quantum systems are generally described by a family of quantum channels (linear, completely positive and trace preserving maps). In this note, we mainly study the range of all possible values of $\|\mathcal{E}\|_2^2+\|\widetilde{\mathcal{E}}\|_2^2$ for quantum channels $\mathcal{E}$ and give the equivalent characterizations for quantum channels that achieve these maximum and minimum values, respectively, where $\|\mathcal{E}\|_2$ is the Hilbert-Schmidt norm of $\mathcal{E}$ and $\widetilde{\mathcal{E}}$ is a complementary channel of $\mathcal{E}.$ Also, we get a concrete description of completely positive maps on infinite dimensional systems preserving pure states. Moreover, the equivalency of several matrix integrals over the unit sphere is demonstrated and some extensions of these matrix integrals are obtained.

### [11] [The two-time Leggett-Garg inequalities of a superconducting qubit interacting with thermal photons in a cavity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10946)
*Hiroo Azuma*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Study of Leggett-Garg inequality violations in a Josephson-junction qubit interacting with magnetic flux, showing temperature-dependent power-law decay of quantum coherence signatures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate quantum coherence and macroscopic realism in a more complex quantum optical model where the photon-qubit interaction involves squared field operators rather than linear ones, extending beyond exactly solvable models.

Method: Analysis of a Josephson-junction qubit interacting with external magnetic flux using second-order perturbation theory to approximate time evolution of the non-exactly-solvable model, with numerical calculations of two-time Leggett-Garg inequalities.

Result: LG inequality violation diminishes with increasing temperature following power laws, with exponents dependent on qubit-photon coupling constant; larger coupling constants reduce both the violation magnitude and temperature sensitivity.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates how environmental temperature and coupling strength affect quantum coherence signatures in complex quantum systems, providing insights into decoherence mechanisms and the persistence of quantum effects in realistic conditions.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the two-time Leggett-Garg (LG) inequalities of a quantum optical model that appears in the Josephson-junction quantum bit (qubit) interacting with an external magnetic flux. This model is a natural extension of an exactly solvable model whose interaction between a qubit and single-mode photons is given by a product of the Pauli $z$ operator of the qubit and a linear combination of annihilation and creation operators of the photons. By contrast, a photon's part of the interaction of our model is given by the square of the linear combination. Because our model is not solvable, we approximately investigate its time evolution up to the second-order perturbation. Our numerical calculations show that violation of the LG inequality diminishes as the temperature increases. Moreover, it exhibits power laws of the temperature, whose exponents vary depending on the coupling constant of the interaction between the qubit and photons. The violation of the LG inequality decreases and becomes less sensitive to the temperature as the coupling constant of the interaction gets larger.

Conclusion: Establishes fundamental limits on communication requirements for distributed quantum measurement simulation with partial information extraction, providing achievable rate regions for this communication scenario.

Abstract: In this paper a central server Charlie has access to a quantum system C and measures it with a POVM $\{Λ_x\}$. Alice and Bob are only interested in the partial results $g_A(x)$ respectively $g_B(x)$. Alice, Bob, and Charlie share common randomness and Alice and Bob only need to faithfully simulate their measurements.

### [13] [Stabilizer Code-Generic Universal Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10964)
*Nicholas J. C. Papadopoulos,Ramin Ayanzadeh*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Universal fault-tolerant quantum computation achieved through novel ancilla-mediated protocols that implement logical Clifford and T gates, making any stabilizer code capable of universal quantum computation without consuming ancilla registers or modifying underlying codes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current error-correcting codes alone cannot achieve universal quantum computation, requiring costly additional techniques like code concatenation, code switching, or magic state distillation that are code-specific and resource-intensive.

Method: Implements logical Clifford and T gates through novel ancilla-mediated protocols that are deterministic, don't consume ancilla registers, don't modify underlying data codes/registers, and are generic over all stabilizer codes using helper codes in ancilla registers and mid-circuit measurements.

Result: Creates a universal fault-tolerant quantum gate set that enables any single stabilizer code to achieve universal quantum computation, while also enabling communication between heterogeneous stabilizer codes.

Conclusion: The approach opens doors for countless possibilities with existing and undiscovered codes, enabling their scalable, heterogeneous coexistence for universal fault-tolerant quantum computation.

Abstract: Fault-tolerant quantum computation allows quantum computations to be carried out while resisting unwanted noise. Several error correcting codes have been developed to achieve this task, but none alone are capable of universal quantum computation. This universality is highly desired and often achieved using additional techniques such as code concatenation, code switching, or magic state distillation, which can be costly and only work for specific codes. This work implements logical Clifford and T gates through novel ancilla-mediated protocols to construct a universal fault-tolerant quantum gate set. Unlike traditional techniques, our implementation is deterministic, does not consume ancilla registers, does not modify the underlying data codes or registers, and is generic over all stabilizer codes. Thus, any single code becomes capable of universal quantum computation by leveraging helper codes in ancilla registers and mid-circuit measurements. Furthermore, since these logical gates are stabilizer code-generic, these implementations enable communication between heterogeneous stabilizer codes. These features collectively open the door to countless possibilities for existing and undiscovered codes as well as their scalable, heterogeneous coexistence.

*Chenlu Li,Hui Zeng,Dazhi Ding*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: NA-QAS is a noise-aware quantum architecture search framework that identifies noise-robust quantum circuits by incorporating noise models into training, using hybrid Hamiltonian ε-greedy optimization and variable-depth NSGA-II for efficient search.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum architecture search (QAS) automates quantum circuit design, but existing approaches don't adequately address noise effects. There's a need for frameworks that can identify noise-robust architectures while balancing expressibility and hardware constraints.

Method: Proposes NA-QAS framework with: 1) Noise model integration into parameterized quantum circuit training, 2) Hybrid Hamiltonian ε-greedy strategy for optimization cost reduction and local optima avoidance, 3) Enhanced variable-depth NSGA-II algorithm for navigating search space and balancing architectural expressibility vs. hardware overhead.

Result: Validated on binary classification and iris multi-classification tasks under noisy conditions. Framework successfully searches for quantum architectures with superior performance and greater resource efficiency compared to existing approaches in noisy environments.

Conclusion: NA-QAS effectively automates noise-robust quantum circuit design, demonstrating improved performance and resource efficiency in noisy quantum computing environments through integrated noise modeling and advanced optimization strategies.

Abstract: Quantum architecture search (QAS) has emerged to automate the design of high-performance quantum circuits under specific tasks and hardware constraints. We propose a noise-aware quantum architecture search (NA-QAS) framework based on variational quantum circuit design. By incorporating a noise model into the training of parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) , the proposed framework identifies the noise-robust architectures. We introduce a hybrid Hamiltonian $\varepsilon$ -greedy strategy to optimize evaluation costs and circumvent local optima. Furthermore, an enhanced variable-depth NSGA-II algorithm is employed to navigate the vast search space, enabling an automated trade-off between architectural expressibility and quantum hardware overhead. The effectiveness of the framework is validated through binary classification and iris multi-classification tasks under a noisy condition. Compared to existing approaches, our framework can search for quantum architectures with superior performance and greater resource efficiency under a noisy condition.

### [15] [Off-resonant preservation and generation of imaginarity in distributed scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10979)
*Si-Min Wang,Ming-Liang Hu,Heng Fan*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Nonlocal advantage of quantum imaginarity (NAQI) and distillable imaginarity of assistance (DIA) are preserved in off-resonant qubit-cavity systems, enabling efficient control of imaginarity resources in distributed quantum scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how imaginarity (treating complex numbers as a quantum resource) can be controlled and preserved in distributed quantum systems, particularly in lossy cavity environments, and to understand the role of off-resonant interactions in maintaining these resources.

Method: Study two qubits interacting with a lossy cavity, analyzing NAQI and DIA under conditions of large symmetric detuning between qubits and cavity. Investigate off-resonant interactions that generate high NAQI and DIA from initial product states with same detunings but unequal couplings to the cavity. Use effective coupling induced by cavity mode to explain physical mechanisms.

Result: Both NAQI and DIA can be well preserved for long times in presence of large symmetric detuning. Off-resonant interactions generate high degree of NAQI and DIA from initial product states. Effective coupling between qubits induced by cavity mode explains the physical mechanism behind this strategy's validity.

Conclusion: Off-resonant interactions play a crucial role in efficient control of imaginarity in distributed scenarios, providing a strategy to preserve and generate imaginarity resources in lossy quantum systems through symmetric detuning and unequal couplings.

Abstract: We study the nonlocal advantage of quantum imaginarity (NAQI) and distillable imaginarity of assistance (DIA), which treat imaginarity as a resource in distributed scenarios. For two qubits interacting with a lossy cavity, it is shown that both the NAQI and DIA can be well preserved for long times in the presence of large and symmetric detuning between the qubits and the cavity. Moreover, the off-resonant interaction generates a high degree of NAQI and DIA from the initial product states of two qubits having the same detunings and unequal couplings to the cavity. Based on the effective coupling of the qubits induced by the cavity mode, we explain the physical mechanism underlying the validity of this strategy. Our findings shed light on the role that off-resonant interactions have in the efficient control of imaginarity in distributed scenarios.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Single fluxonium qubit at zero flux achieves erasure conversion in 0-2 subspace using engineered resonator for mid-circuit detection and end-of-line measurement, increasing logical lifetime 4.5× and achieving low erasure-check error.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing erasure qubit implementations (dual-rail encoded in superconducting cavities/transmons) provide high-fidelity operations but suffer from increased hardware overhead and circuit complexity. The paper aims to address these limitations by implementing erasure conversion in a more resource-efficient platform.

Method: Use single fluxonium operated at zero flux with logical state encoded in 0-2 subspace. A single, carefully engineered resonator provides both mid-circuit erasure detection and end-of-line logical measurement. Post-selection is applied on non-erasure outcomes to improve logical performance.

Result: Post-selection increased logical lifetime from 193 μs to 869 μs (4.5× improvement). Characterization of measurement-induced logical dephasing showed each erasure check contributes negligible error of 7.2×10^-5. The system demonstrates erasure conversion without requiring additional hardware.

Conclusion: Integer-fluxonium is established as a promising, resource-efficient platform for erasure-based error mitigation, offering the benefits of erasure qubits without the hardware overhead of previous implementations.

Abstract: Qubits that experience predominantly erasure errors offer distinct advantages for fault-tolerant operation. Indeed, dual-rail encoded erasure qubits in superconducting cavities and transmons have demonstrated high-fidelity operations by converting physical-qubit relaxation into logical-qubit erasures, but this comes at the cost of increased hardware overhead and circuit complexity. Here, we address these limitations by realizing erasure conversion in a single fluxonium operated at zero flux, where the logical state is encoded in its 0-2 subspace. A single, carefully engineered resonator provides both mid-circuit erasure detection and end-of-line (EOL) logical measurement. Post-selection on non-erasure outcomes results in more than four-fold increase of the logical lifetime, from $193~μ$s to $869~μ$s. Finally, we characterize measurement-induced logical dephasing as a function of measurement power and frequency, and infer that each erasure check contributes a negligible error of $7.2\times 10^{-5}$. These results establish integer-fluxonium as a promising, resource-efficient platform for erasure-based error mitigation, without requiring additional hardware.

TL;DR: AI-assisted quantum key distribution using orbital angular momentum on UAVs with turbulence compensation and composable security


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable secure quantum communication on mobile UAV platforms by addressing challenges of atmospheric turbulence, pointing errors, and non-stationary flight conditions while maintaining composable security

Method: Combines OAM-encoded BB84 protocol with unified channel modeling (Kolmogorov turbulence, pointing misalignment, aperture clipping), weak+vacuum decoy states, composable finite key analysis, and physics-informed AI module for performance stabilization

Result: Simulations show AI-assisted method improves secret key rate by 10-30% under moderate turbulence and milliradian pointing jitter while preserving composable security

Conclusion: The framework enables practical QKD on UAV platforms by integrating physical modeling, composable security analysis, and AI-based adaptive compensation for turbulence and flight dynamics

Abstract: We present a theoretical framework for quantum key distribution (QKD) using orbital angular momentum (OAM) encoded BB84 on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) platform. A unified channel model captures Kolmogorov turbulence, pointing induced misalignment, and finite aperture clipping, enabling quantitative predictions of inter mode crosstalk and the resulting quantum bit error rate (QBER). Using a weak plus vacuum decoy state formulation, we derive composable finite key lower bounds on the secret key rate that incorporate statistical fluctuations, detector dark counts, efficiency mismatch, and error correction leakage. To stabilize performance under non stationary flight conditions, we introduce a lightweight physics informed learning module that combines physical priors with measured link statistics to classify valid pulses, reject corrupted data, and recommend decoding strategies. We outline a complete evaluation pipeline including UAV system architecture, turbulence driven QBER maps, decoy optimization, finite key scaling, and AI calibration metrics. Simulations indicate that under moderate turbulence and milliradian level pointing jitter, the proposed AI assisted method can improve the secret key rate by 10 percent to 30 percent while preserving composable security.

TL;DR: Three-body bound states in continuum (BIC) formation studied via pole trajectories in complex energy plane using 1D model with Gaussian potentials, revealing parametric nature and sensitivity to kinematic structure over interaction details.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the formation of three-body bound states in the continuum (BIC) and understand how they emerge as parametric phenomena under variation of system parameters like interaction strength, range, and mass ratio.

Method: Used a one-dimensional model of two identical bosons and a distinguishable particle interacting via Gaussian potentials. Systematically traced pole trajectories in the complex energy plane while varying interaction strength, interaction range, and mass ratio.

Result: Confirmed parametric nature of few-body BICs and extended characterization to broader parameter space. Found that variations in interaction parameters and mass ratio can lead to formation of at least one three-body BIC. Mass ratio variation produced more regular patterns with multiple BIC locations compared to interaction parameter variations.

Conclusion: The mechanism of few-body BIC formation is more sensitive to the kinematic structure (mass ratio) of the problem than to specific details of the two-body interaction, suggesting kinematic factors play a dominant role in BIC emergence.

Abstract: We investigate the formation of three-body bound states in the continuum by tracing pole trajectories in the complex energy plane under variation of system parameters. Using a one-dimensional model of two identical bosons and a distinguishable particle interacting via Gaussian potentials, we systematically vary the interaction strength, interaction range, and mass ratio. Our results confirm the parametric nature of few-body bound states in a continuum (BIC) and extend this characterization to a broader set of system parameters. Specifically, we find that variations of both interaction parameters and the mass ratio can lead to the formation of at least one three-body BIC. However, the exact shape of trajectories differs, and for the mass ratio variation we find a more regular pattern with multiple BIC locations. These results suggest that the mechanism of few-body BIC formation is more sensitive to the kinematic structure of the problem than to the specific details of the two-body interaction.

TL;DR: Circular-modulated concatenated continuous driving (CM-CCD) improves qubit gate fidelity by simultaneously modulating amplitude and phase to create circular polarization, eliminating systematic pulse-area errors from imperfect rotating wave approximation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome systematic pulse-area errors in fast quantum gates caused by imperfect rotating wave approximation in conventional concatenated continuous driving (CCD) schemes, and to improve gate fidelity and robustness against parameter variations in qubit arrays.

Method: Proposes a new CCD variant that simultaneously modulates both amplitude and phase of the driving field to generate circularly-polarized field in the rotating frame, canceling counter-rotating terms in the second rotating frame. Implemented and compared different CCD protocols using an electron spin-qubit in isotopically purified 28Si-MOS quantum dot, evaluating robustness against static detuning and Rabi frequency errors.

Result: CM-CCD achieves higher gate fidelity than conventional CCD schemes in numerical simulations. Experimental implementation shows significantly improved robustness compared to standard Rabi-drive against variations in qubit frequency, coupling to Rabi drive, and low frequency noise.

Conclusion: The circular-modulated CCD scheme effectively suppresses noise and systematic errors, making it suitable for qubit arrays with parameter variations, and can be applied to various physical systems including trapped atoms, cold atoms, superconducting qubits, and NV-centers.

Abstract: The rate of coherence loss is lower for a qubit under Rabi drive compared to a freely evolving qubit, $T_{2}^{\rm{Rabi}}>T_{2}^*$.
  Building on this principle, concatenated continuous driving (CCD) keeps the qubit under continuous drive to suppress noise and manipulate dressed states by either phase or amplitude modulation.
  In this work, we propose a new variant of CCD which simultaneously modulates both the amplitude and phase of the driving field to generate a circularly-polarized field in the rotating frame of the carrier frequency.
  This circular-modulated (CM)-CCD cancels the counter-rotating term in the second rotating frame, eliminating a systematic pulse-area error that arises from an imperfect rotating wave approximation for fast gates.
  Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed CMCCD achieves higher gate fidelity than conventional CCD schemes.
  We further implement and compare different CCD protocols using an electron spin-qubit in an isotopically purified $^{28}$Si-MOS quantum dot and evaluate its robustness by applying static detuning and Rabi frequency errors.
  The robustness is significantly improved compared to standard Rabi-drive, showing the effectiveness of this scheme for qubit arrays with variation in qubit frequency, coupling to Rabi drive, and low frequency noise.
  The proposed scheme can be applied to various physical systems, including trapped atoms, cold atoms, superconducting qubits, and NV-centers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish connections between shortcuts to adiabaticity (STA) in quantum systems and scattering theory concepts, and to understand STA completions through squeezed state formalism.

Method: Exploit analogy between 1D quantum mechanics and QFT, use correspondence between Bogoliubov coefficients in QHO and transmission/reflection amplitudes in scattering theory, and connect particle creation to squeezed states.

Result: STA protocols for QHO with time-dependent frequency correspond to transmission resonances; STA in QFT with non-stationary backgrounds correspond to reflectionless potentials; STA completions can be understood via anti-squeezing operators.

Conclusion: Scattering theory provides a unified framework for understanding STA across quantum systems, with STA protocols mapping to specific scattering properties and completions relating to squeezed state operations.

Abstract: We analyze shortcuts to adiabaticity (STA) and their completions for the quantum harmonic oscillator (QHO) with time-dependent frequency, as well as for quantum field theory (QFT) in non-stationary backgrounds. We exploit the analogy with one-dimensional quantum mechanics, and the well known correspondence between Bogoliubov coefficients in the QHO and transmission/reflection amplitudes in scattering theory. Within this framework, STA protocols for the QHO are equivalent to transmission resonances, while STA in QFT with homogeneous backgrounds correspond to reflectionless potentials. Moreover, using the connection between particle creation and squeezed states, we show how STA completions can be understood in terms of the anti-squeezing operator.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Demonstration of a harmonic parity qubit (HPQ) that enables control over the parity of Cooper pair tunneling in superconducting circuits by combining tunnel junctions with a gate-tunable nanowire junction, achieving suppression of odd harmonics and enabling even-dominated regimes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Superconducting quantum circuits rely on Josephson junctions, where the energy-phase relation typically contains both fundamental cosφ terms and higher Fourier harmonics cos(kφ). The parity (odd vs. even) of the dominant tunneling process creates qualitatively different properties, but accessing even-dominated regimes has been challenging and previously required complex multi-junction or hybrid architectures.

Method: Developed a "harmonic parity qubit" (HPQ) combining two aluminum-oxide tunnel junctions in parallel with a gate-tunable InAs/Al nanowire junction to form a SQUID. Conducted spectroscopy versus magnetic flux to reconstruct the energy-phase relation at 85 different gate voltage points, enabling analysis of harmonic content.

Result: At half flux quantum, achieved suppression of odd harmonics by up to two orders of magnitude relative to even harmonics. This produces a double-well potential dominated by even harmonics with minima near ±π/2, enabling supercurrent carried by pairs of Cooper pairs and control over harmonic parity.

Conclusion: The HPQ provides a simple approach to control harmonic parity in superconducting circuits, enabling access to even-dominated regimes without complex architectures. This offers a new building block for Fourier engineering and expands capabilities for superconducting quantum technologies.

Abstract: Superconducting quantum circuits derive their nonlinearity from the Josephson energy-phase relation. Besides the fundamental $\cosφ$ term, this relation can also contain higher Fourier harmonics $\cos(kφ)$ corresponding to correlated tunneling of $k$ Cooper pairs. The parity of the dominant tunneling process, i.e.~whether an odd or even number of Cooper pairs tunnel, results in qualitatively different properties, and controlling this opens up a wide range of applications in superconducting technology. However, access to even-dominated regimes has remained challenging and has so far relied on complex multi-junction or all-hybrid architectures. Here, we demonstrate a simple "harmonic parity qubit" (HPQ); an element that combines two aluminum-oxide tunnel junctions in parallel to a gate-tunable InAs/Al nanowire junction forming a SQUID, and use spectroscopy versus flux to reconstruct its energy-phase relation at 85 gate voltage points. At half flux quantum, the odd harmonics of the Josephson potential can be suppressed by up to two orders of magnitude relative to the even harmonics, producing a double-well potential dominated by even harmonics with minima near $\pmπ/2$. The ability to control harmonic parity enables supercurrent carried by pairs of Cooper pairs and provides a new building block for Fourier engineering in superconducting circuits.

TL;DR: Two-qubit gate errors are shown to scale with noise power at frequency matching the dressed-state energy splitting (2g), revealing a universal frequency-selective relaxation mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior studies treat dephasing noise as Markovian or low-frequency, but realistic qubit environments have structured, frequency-dependent spectra. Understanding error mechanisms at specific frequencies matching inter-qubit coupling is essential for building high-fidelity quantum processors.

Method: Combined theoretical analysis and experimental verification on superconducting qubits with engineered noise spectra. The study examines how noise at frequencies matching the dressed-state energy splitting (set by inter-qubit coupling strength g) induces distinct relaxation channels.

Result: Two-qubit gate errors scale predictably with noise power spectral density at frequency 2g, extending the concept of T₁ρ relaxation to interacting systems. This frequency-selective relaxation mechanism is universal across platforms and sets coherence limits for dual-rail or singlet-triplet encodings.

Conclusion: Noise at frequencies matching the dressed-state energy splitting induces a distinct relaxation channel that degrades gate performance, enriching our understanding of decoherence pathways during gate operations and providing insights for improving quantum processor fidelity.

Abstract: Understanding error mechanisms in two-qubit gate operations is essential for building high-fidelity quantum processors. While prior studies predominantly treat dephasing noise as either Markovian or predominantly low-frequency, realistic qubit environments exhibit structured, frequency-dependent spectra. Here we demonstrate that noise at frequencies matching the dressed-state energy splitting--set by the inter-qubit coupling strength g--induces a distinct relaxation channel that degrades gate performance. Through combined theoretical analysis and experimental verification on superconducting qubits with engineered noise spectra, we show that two-qubit gate errors scale predictably with the noise power spectral density at frequency 2g, extending the concept of $T_{1ρ}$ relaxation to interacting systems. This frequency-selective relaxation mechanism, universal across platforms, enriches our understanding of decoherence pathways during gate operations. The same mechanism sets coherence limits for dual-rail or singlet-triplet encodings.

Conclusion: Establishes operational feasibility and scaling behavior for hybrid skyrmion-quantum platforms, outlining a path toward integrating skyrmion-based quantum components into practical device architectures for low-dissipation, unidirectional quantum information transport.

Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions are topologically protected spin textures known for their robustness against perturbations. Their topological stability makes them robust information carriers, ideal for tackling a key challenge in quantum computing: creating reliable, one-way links between different types of qubits. In this proof-of-concept study, we introduce a novel device - the skyrmion quantum diode - based on skyrmion qubits. Our approach combines classical micromagnetic simulations, achieving skyrmion diameters as small as 3 nm, with quantum circuit models inspired by superconducting qubits. In this work, we demonstrate: (i) unidirectional skyrmion transport via the skyrmion Hall effect in asymmetric junctions, spanning length scales from 20 nm down to 3 nm; (ii) potential compatibility with flux-tunable quantum architectures; and (iii) preliminary insights into anharmonicity in skyrmion-based qubit systems. These results establish both the operational feasibility and the scaling behavior necessary for a hybrid skyrmion-quantum platform. Our work outlines a path toward integrating skyrmion based quantum components into practical device architectures, enabling low-dissipation, unidirectional quantum information transport. This capability is crucial for scalable quantum computing, spintronic logic, and hybrid quantum systems, and opens opportunities for chipscale, pump-free isolators and directional quantum links that enhance readout fidelity, reduce cryogenic load, and support modular skyrmion-superconducting processors

*Markus Frembs,Cihan Okay,Ho Yiu Chung*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper explores connections between measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC) and linear constraint systems (LCS), showing that state-dependent contextuality in MBQC generally doesn't lead to state-independent contextuality in associated LCS solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge two perspectives on quantum contextuality: state-dependent contextuality as a resource in MBQC versus state-independent contextuality in quantum solutions to LCS, and understand their relationship.

Method: Associates linear constraint systems to MBQC exhibiting strong state-dependent contextuality, then analyzes whether measurement operators in such MBQC yield quantum solutions to the associated LCS, representing state-independent contextuality.

Result: Main result rules out quantum solutions to associated LCS for a large class of MBQC, showing state-dependent contextuality in MBQC doesn't generally imply state-independent contextuality in LCS solutions.

Conclusion: The work sharpens the distinction between state-dependent and state-independent forms of contextuality, and generalizes previous results on non-existence of quantum solutions to LCS in finite odd prime dimensions.

Abstract: We combine the study of resources in measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC) with that of quantum solutions to linear constraint systems (LCS). Contextuality of the input state in MBQC has been identified as a key resource for quantum advantage, and in a stronger form, underlies algebraic relations between (measurement) operators which obey classically unsatisfiable (linear) constraints. Here, we compare these two perspectives on contextuality, and study to what extent they are related. More precisely, we associate a LCS to certain MBQC which exhibit strong forms of state-dependent contextuality, and ask if the measurement operators in such MBQC give rise to state-independent contextuality in the form of quantum solutions of its associated LCS. Our main result rules out such quantum solutions for a large class of MBQC. This both sharpens the distinction between state-dependent and state-independent forms of contextuality, and further generalises results on the non-existence of quantum solutions to LCS in finite odd (prime) dimension.

Motivation: To develop a compact, tunable interface between transmon qubits and waveguide modes for quantum information processing applications, addressing the need for fast reset, metrology, and quantum communication interfaces in quantum networks.

Method: Developed a double transmon coupler (DTC) circuit as a drop-in, tunable link between transmon qubits and waveguide continuum.

Result: Achieved 60% overall photon detection efficiency, with 95% detection efficiency at the measurement TED input. Reset and photon emission/detection each require about 2μs, resulting in a minimum protocol duration of 4μs for the chosen TED parameters.

Conclusion: Transmon-waveguide links like the DTC serve crucial roles in quantum information processors by providing mechanisms for unconditional fast reset, metrology, and quantum communication interfaces for quantum networking applications.

Abstract: We showcase the recently developed double transmon coupler (DTC) circuit as a compact, drop-in, tunable and transition-selective link between an otherwise coherent transmon and the continuum of modes in a waveguide. We use these transmon-DTC devices as transmon emitter/dectectors (TEDs) for microwave photons. We highlight the flexibility of these devices by sending photons from a source TED to a measurement TED using a meter of coaxial cable and a circulator, each TED with nominally identical circuit parameters. We detect $60\,\%$ of the photons using this setup where we infer that $95\,\%$ of the photons at the input of the measurement TED are detected. Reset and photon emission/detection each require about $2\,μ$s, for a minimum protocol duration of $4\,μ$s, for our choice of TED parameters. Transmon-waveguide links like the DTC serve an important role in quantum information processors: they provide a mechanism for unconditional fast reset, metrology, and as nascent quantum communication interfaces for quantum networking.

TL;DR: Quantum-enhanced optimization for patient stratification in clinical trials reduces covariate imbalance, improves statistical power, and achieves 100x computational efficiency gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical trials suffer from high failure rates and costs due to biological uncertainty and inadequate patient stratification, which causes covariate imbalances that mask treatment effects and reduce statistical power.

Method: Optimization-based, quantum-enhanced approach to patient stratification that minimizes covariate imbalance across numerical and categorical variables without altering protocol design or trial endpoints, using hybrid quantum-classical optimization methods.

Result: Quantum-enhanced pipeline delivered over 100x improvement in computational efficiency compared to classical approaches, with up to fivefold increase in statistical significance in treatment effect estimation, reducing treatment-effect dilution and increasing trial sensitivity.

Conclusion: Optimization-driven stratification can strengthen clinical trial design, improve confidence in downstream decisions, and reduce the risk of costly late-stage failure.

Abstract: Clinical trials are notorious for their high failure rates and steep costs, leading to wasted time and resources spend, prolonged development timelines, and delayed patient access to new therapies. A key contributor to these failures is biological uncertainty, which complicates trial design and weakens the ability to detect true treatment effects. In particular, inadequate patient stratification often results in covariate imbalances across treatment arms, masking treatment effects and reducing statistical power, even when therapies are effective for specific patient subpopulations. This work presents an optimization-based, quantum-enhanced approach to patient stratification that explicitly minimizes covariate imbalance across numerical and categorical variables, without altering protocol design or trial endpoints. Using real clinical trial data, we demonstrate that hybrid quantum-classical optimization methods achieve high-quality stratification while scaling efficiently to larger cohorts. In our benchmark study, the quantum-enhanced pipeline delivered over a 100x improvement in computational efficiency compared to classical approaches, enabling faster iteration and practical deployment at scale. This report shows how improved stratification can lead to decision-relevant gains, including up to a fivefold increase in statistical significance in treatment effect estimation, reducing treatment-effect dilution and increasing trial sensitivity. Together, these results show that optimization-driven stratification can strengthen clinical trial design, improve confidence in downstream decisions, and reduce the risk of costly late-stage failure.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need efficient quantum circuit implementations for continuous-time quantum walks on arbitrary sparse graphs, as standard Pauli-based simulation pipelines are resource-intensive.

Method: Decompose quantum walk Hamiltonian into implementable Hamiltonians corresponding to graph matchings, use graph compression to merge edges, convert to circuits using CX and CRx gates without Pauli decomposition, and Trotterize components.

Result: Matching decomposition consistently outperforms Pauli decomposition with up to 43% fewer controlled gates and 54% shallower circuits across multiple graph families, with some cases enabling exact simulation.

Conclusion: Matching decomposition provides a superior approach for implementing continuous-time quantum walks on sparse graphs, offering substantial resource reductions and enabling exact simulation in certain cases.

Abstract: In this work, we present a new algorithm for generating quantum circuits that efficiently implement continuous time quantum walks on arbitrary simple sparse graphs. The algorithm, called matching decomposition, works by decomposing a continuous-time quantum walk Hamiltonian into a collection of exactly implementable Hamiltonians corresponding to matchings in the underlying graph followed by a novel graph compression algorithm that merges edges in the graph. Lastly, we convert the walks to a circuit and Trotterize over these components. The dynamics of the walker on each edge in the matching can be implemented in the circuit model as sequences of CX and CRx gates. We do not use Pauli decomposition when implementing walks along each matching. Furthermore, we compare matching decomposition to a standard Pauli-based simulation pipeline and find that matching decomposition consistently yields substantial resource reductions, requiring up to 43% fewer controlled gates and up to 54% shallower circuits than Pauli decomposition across multiple graph families. Finally, we also present examples and theoretical results for when matching decomposition can exactly simulate a continuous-time quantum walk on a graph.

Abstract: A central building block of a heat engine is the working fluid, which mediates the conversion of heat into work. In nanoscale heat engines, the working fluid can be a quantum system whose behavior and dynamics are non-classical. A particularly versatile realization is a quantum resonator, which allows for precise control and coupling to thermal reservoirs, making it an ideal platform for exploring quantum thermodynamic processes. Here, we investigate the thermodynamic properties of a driven quantum resonator whose temperature is controlled by modulating its natural frequency. We evaluate the work performed by the external drive and the resulting heat flow between the resonator and its environment, both within linear response and beyond. To further elucidate these processes, we determine the full distribution of photon exchanges between the resonator and its environment, characterized by its first few cumulants. Our results provide quantitative insights into the interplay between heat, work, and fluctuations, and may help in designing future heat engines.
