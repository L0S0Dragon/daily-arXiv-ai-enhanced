In this work, we identify entanglement as the key resource that enables local random unitaries to generate global random states by effectively gluing randomness across the system. Specifically, we demonstrate that approximate random states can be produced from an entangled state $|\u03c8\\rangle$ through the application of local random unitaries. We show that the resulting ensemble forms an approximate state design with an error saturating as $\u0398(e^{-\\mathcal{N}_2(\u03c8)})$, where $\\mathcal{N}_2(\u03c8)$ is the second R\u00e9nyi entanglement entropy of $|\u03c8\\rangle$. Furthermore, we prove that this tight bound also applies to the second R\u00e9nyi entropy of coherence when the ensemble is constructed using coherence-free operations. These results imply that, when restricted to resource-free gates, the quality of the generated random states is determined entirely by the resource content of the initial state. Notably, we find that among all $\u03b1$-R\u00e9nyi entropeis, the second R\u00e9nyi entropy yields the tightest bounds. Consequently, these second R\u00e9nyi entropies can be interpreted as the maximal capacities for generating randomness using resource-free operations.
