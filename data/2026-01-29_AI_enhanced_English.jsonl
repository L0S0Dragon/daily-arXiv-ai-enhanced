In this work, we introduce a manufacturing approach that brings diamond quantum photonics closer to industrial production. Instead of sequentially defining each device by lithography written directly on diamond, we fabricate high-precision silicon masks using commercial semiconductor foundries and transfer them onto diamond via microtransfer printing.

In this context, the Variational Monte Carlo (VMC) framework based on Projected Entangled Pair States (PEPS) has witnessed rapid development, establishing itself as a vital approach for investigating strongly correlated two-dimensional systems. However, standard PEPS-VMC algorithms predominantly rely on sequential local updates. This conventional approach often suffers from slow convergence and critical slowing down, particularly in the vicinity of phase transitions or within frustrated landscapes. To address these limitations, we propose an efficient autoregressive row-wise sampling algorithm for PEPS that enables direct, rejection-free sampling via single-layer contractions. By utilizing autoregressive single-layer row updates to generate collective, non-local configuration proposals, our method significantly reduces temporal correlations compared to local Metropolis moves. We benchmark the algorithm on the two-dimensional transverse-field Ising model and the quantum spin glass.

Multi-angle QAOA (MA-QAOA), which assigns independent parameters to each Hamiltonian operator term, achieves superior approximation performance even with fewer layers than standard QAOA. Unfortunately, this increased expressibility can raise the classical computational cost due to a greater number of parameters. The recently proposed Layerwise MA-QAOA (LMA-QAOA) reduces this overhead by training one layer at a time, but it may suffer from obtaining the precise solution due to the previously fixed parameters. This work addresses two questions for efficient MA-QAOA training: (i) What is the optimal granularity for parameter updates per epoch, and (ii) How can we get precise final cost function results while only partially updating the parameters per epoch? Despite the benefit of reducing the parameters that update per epoch can reduce the classical computation overhead, too fine or coarse a granularity of Hamiltonian update can degrade the MA-QAOA training efficiency. We find that optimizing one complete layer per epoch is an efficient granularity. Moreover, selectively retraining each layer by tracking gradient variations can achieve a final cost function equivalent to the standard MA-QAOA while lowering the parameter update overhead. Based on these insights, we propose Orbit-QAOA, which cyclically revisits layers and selectively freezes stabilized parameters.

Superconducting quantum processors have demonstrated high-fidelity operations, but on larger devices there is commonly a broad distribution of qualities, with the low-performing tail affecting near-term performance and applications. Here we present an error budgeting procedure for the native two-qubit operation on a 32-qubit superconducting-qubit-based quantum computer, the OQC Toshiko gen-1 system. We estimate the prevalence of different forms of error such as coherent error and control qubit leakage, then apply error suppression strategies based on the most significant sources of error, making use of pulse-shaping and additional compensating gates. These techniques require no additional hardware overhead and little additional calibration, making them suitable for routine adoption. An average reduction of 3.7x in error rate for two qubit operations is shown across a chain of 16 qubits, with the median error rate improving from 4.6$\\%$ to 1.2$\\%$ as measured by interleaved randomized benchmarking. The largest improvements are seen on previously under-performing qubit pairs, demonstrating the importance of practical error suppression in reducing the low-performing tail of gate qualities and achieving consistently good performance across a device.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error budgeting and suppression techniques reduce two-qubit gate errors by 3.7x on a 32-qubit superconducting quantum computer, improving median error rate from 4.6% to 1.2% through pulse-shaping and compensating gates.", "motivation": "Superconducting quantum processors show broad distributions of gate qualities, with low-performing tails affecting near-term performance and applications.

For the free particle, quantum fluctuations induce measurable phase shifts in azimuthal precession of approximately 8-12%, with uncertainty growth rates proportional to initial moment correlations. When a non-central Makarov potential is introduced, quantum corrections dramatically amplify its asymmetry. For strong coupling ($\u03b3$ = -1.9), the quantum-corrected force drives trajectories preferentially toward the southern hemisphere on timescales 40% shorter than classical predictions, with trajectory densities exhibiting up to 3-fold enhancement in the preferred region. Throughout evolution, the solutions rigorously satisfy Heisenberg uncertainty relations, validating the truncation scheme. These results demonstrate that quantum effects fundamentally alter semiclassical dynamics in curved constrained systems, with direct implications for charge transport in carbon nanostructures, exciton dynamics in curved quantum wells, and reaction pathways in cyclic molecules.", "AI": {"tldr": "Quantum-corrected semiclassical dynamics on curved surfaces using momentous quantum mechanics reveals significant quantum back-reaction effects, including measurable phase shifts, amplified potential asymmetries, and accelerated trajectory dynamics compared to classical predictions.", "motivation": "To develop a semiclassical framework for studying quantum particles constrained to curved surfaces, extending beyond classical descriptions to incorporate quantum back-reaction effects that fundamentally alter dynamics in constrained systems.", "method": "Uses momentous quantum mechanics formalism to extend classical phase-space with quantum fluctuation variables (moments).

The possibility of passive QEC has so far only been established in an unphysical number of spatial dimensions. In this work, we present a simple method for autonomous QEC in two spatial dimensions, formulated as a quantum cellular automaton with a fixed, local and translation-invariant update rule. The construction uses hierarchical, self-simulating control elements based on the classical schemes from the seminal results of G\u00e1cs (1986, 1989) together with a measurement-free concatenated code. We analyze the system under a local noise model and prove a noise threshold below which the logical errors are suppressed arbitrarily with increasing system size and the memory lifetime diverges in the thermodynamic limit. The scheme admits a continuous-time implementation as a time-independent, translation-invariant local Lindbladian with engineered dissipative jump operators. Further, the recursive nature of our protocol allows for the fault-tolerant encoding of arbitrary quantum circuits and thus constitutes a self-correcting universal quantum computer.", "AI": {"tldr": "A method for autonomous quantum error correction in 2D using quantum cellular automata with local, translation-invariant rules, achieving fault-tolerant quantum computation without active measurements.", "motivation": "Standard quantum error correction requires active maintenance with measurements and classical processing, while passive QEC has only been established in unphysical spatial dimensions.

This approach enforces all physical constraints exactly, yielding a globally unconstrained variational formulation of the bosonic ground-state problem. The unconstrained structure also naturally supports solution reuse across nearby Hamiltonians: warm-starting from previously optimized covariance matrices substantially reduces the number of optimization steps required for convergence in families of related configurations, as encountered in crystal lattices, molecular systems, and fluids.
