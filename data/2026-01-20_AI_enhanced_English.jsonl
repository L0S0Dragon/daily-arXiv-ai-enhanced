A key contributor to these failures is biological uncertainty, which complicates trial design and weakens the ability to detect true treatment effects. In particular, inadequate patient stratification often results in covariate imbalances across treatment arms, masking treatment effects and reducing statistical power, even when therapies are effective for specific patient subpopulations. This work presents an optimization-based, quantum-enhanced approach to patient stratification that explicitly minimizes covariate imbalance across numerical and categorical variables, without altering protocol design or trial endpoints. Using real clinical trial data, we demonstrate that hybrid quantum-classical optimization methods achieve high-quality stratification while scaling efficiently to larger cohorts. In our benchmark study, the quantum-enhanced pipeline delivered over a 100x improvement in computational efficiency compared to classical approaches, enabling faster iteration and practical deployment at scale. This report shows how improved stratification can lead to decision-relevant gains, including up to a fivefold increase in statistical significance in treatment effect estimation, reducing treatment-effect dilution and increasing trial sensitivity. Together, these results show that optimization-driven stratification can strengthen clinical trial design, improve confidence in downstream decisions, and reduce the risk of costly late-stage failure.", "AI": {"tldr": "Quantum-enhanced optimization for clinical trial patient stratification reduces covariate imbalance, improves statistical power 5x, and achieves 100x computational efficiency gains over classical methods.", "motivation": "Clinical trials suffer from high failure rates and costs due to biological uncertainty and inadequate patient stratification, which causes covariate imbalances that mask treatment effects and reduce statistical power.", "method": "Optimization-based, quantum-enhanced approach to patient stratification that minimizes covariate imbalance across numerical and categorical variables without altering protocol design or trial endpoints, using hybrid quantum-classical optimization methods.", "result": "Quantum-enhanced pipeline delivered over 100x improvement in computational efficiency compared to classical approaches, enabling faster iteration and practical deployment at scale, with up to fivefold increase in statistical significance in treatment effect estimation.", "conclusion": "Optimization-driven stratification strengthens clinical trial design, improves confidence in downstream decisions, reduces treatment-effect dilution, increases trial sensitivity, and reduces risk of costly late-stage failure."}}

The algorithm, called matching decomposition, works by decomposing a continuous-time quantum walk Hamiltonian into a collection of exactly implementable Hamiltonians corresponding to matchings in the underlying graph followed by a novel graph compression algorithm that merges edges in the graph. Lastly, we convert the walks to a circuit and Trotterize over these components. The dynamics of the walker on each edge in the matching can be implemented in the circuit model as sequences of CX and CRx gates. We do not use Pauli decomposition when implementing walks along each matching. Furthermore, we compare matching decomposition to a standard Pauli-based simulation pipeline and find that matching decomposition consistently yields substantial resource reductions, requiring up to 43% fewer controlled gates and up to 54% shallower circuits than Pauli decomposition across multiple graph families.
