### [1] [Nonclassicality of multi-photon-added cat states](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08894)
*Jhordan Santiago,Petr Steindl*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Photon addition to cat states creates states with swapped parity, sub-Poissonian statistics, and amplitude-squared squeezing, useful for quantum imaging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the properties of multi-photon-added cat states created by applying creation operators to cat states, and explore their potential applications in quantum technologies.

Method: Construct multi-photon-added cat states by repeatedly applying creation operators to cat states, then analyze their photon-number distribution, Q parameter, squeezing properties, and Wigner function.

Result: Photon addition induces π phase shift in parity configuration for odd photon additions, creates sub-Poissonian statistics regardless of coherent state phase, loses quadrature squeezing but gains amplitude-squared squeezing, and can be generated with existing hardware.

Conclusion: Multi-photon-added cat states are valuable resources for quantum imaging due to their sub-Poissonian statistics and amplitude-squared squeezing, with practical generation feasibility using current technology.

Abstract: Multi-photon-added cat states are constructed by repeatedly applying the creation operator to a cat state. We study in detail their photon-number distribution, $Q$ parameter, squeezing properties, and Wigner function. We show that photon addition induces a $π$ phase shift in the original parity configuration whenever an odd number of photons is added, reflected as swapped vanishing probabilities and phase space displacements at the origin. Remarkably, the same process drives these states into a sub-Poissonian regime regardless of the relative phase between their coherent state components, making them valuable resources for quantum imaging, at the cost of losing quadrature squeezing, but gaining amplitude-squared one. We also discuss how these states can be generated using existing hardware.

*Xin Wei,Zeyang Li,Abhishek V. Karve,Adam L. Shaw,David I. Schuster,Jonathan Simon*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A new spatial light modulator combining 2D pixel geometry with MHz-speed operation using frequency-encoded spatial information and a novel re-imaging phased array spectrometer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current wavefront shaping technologies face a fundamental trade-off: spatial light modulators (SLMs) offer high pixel count but low refresh rates, while acousto-optic deflectors (AODs) provide moderate speed with restricted beam geometries. There is no existing tool that provides MHz-rate, continuous motion, and arbitrarily reconfigurable control over diffraction-limited spots.

Method: The device encodes spatial information in frequency bins via a broadband optical phase modulator and decodes them using a first-of-its-kind high-resolution 2D spectrometer called the Re-Imaging Phased Array (RIPA). The RIPA achieves sensitivity through long path-lengths enabled by intra-spectrometer re-imaging lens-guides.

Result: Demonstrated site-resolved optical pulsing with 44(1) ns rise time (exceeding 10 million frames per second), arbitrary reconfigurable 2D addressing, and multi-site operations including asynchronous independent beam motion, splitting, and recombination.

Conclusion: This new class of spatial light modulator opens new horizons in rapid optical manipulation across science, enabling fast scalable control approaching inertial and radiation limits of atoms in quantum processors, and dynamically programmable microsecond-resolved illumination in microscopy and neuro-biological imaging.

Abstract: Rapid and programmable shaping of light fields is central to modern microscopy, display technologies, optical communications and sensing, quantum engineering, and quantum information processing. Current wavefront shaping technologies face a fundamental dichotomy: spatial light modulators (SLMs) offer high pixel count but suffer from low refresh rates, while acousto-optic deflectors (AODs) provide moderate speed with restricted optical beam geometries. Though recent advances in photonic integrated circuits achieve fast switching, there is currently no tool that provides MHz-rate, continuous motion, and arbitrarily reconfigurable control over a set of diffraction-limited spots. Here we introduce a new class of spatial light modulator that provides both 2D pixel geometry and high speed. The device operates by encoding spatial information in frequency bins via a broadband optical phase modulator, and decoding them via a first-of-its-kind, high-resolution 2D spectrometer. The spectrometer, based on the architecture which we call the Re-Imaging Phased Array (RIPA), achieves its sensitivity through long path-lengths, enabled by intra-spectrometer re-imaging lens-guides. We demonstrate site-resolved optical pulsing with a 44(1)~ns rise time, corresponding to frame rates exceeding 10 million frames per second, as well as arbitrary, reconfigurable 2D addressing and multi-site operations, including asynchronous, independent beam motion, splitting, and recombination. Leveraging these tools opens new horizons in rapid optical manipulation of matter across science, from fast, scalable control that approaches the inertial and radiation limits of atoms in quantum processors, to dynamically programmable, microsecond-resolved illumination in microscopy and neuro-biological imaging.

*Ambuj,Anushko Chattopadhyay,Kunika Agarwal,Rakesh Das,Amit Mukherjee*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Superadditivity of one-shot zero-error classical capacity is demonstrated using a noisy classical channel in parallel with a perfect quantum channel, enabling transmission of more messages than the product of individual capacities, with quantum advantage rooted in Kochen-Specker contextuality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether combining a noisy classical channel with a perfect quantum channel can enable transmission of more perfectly distinguishable messages than the product of their individual capacities, exploring potential quantum advantages in communication scenarios.

Method: Asymmetric communication setting with parallel use of a noisy classical channel and a perfect quantum channel. Explicit constructions are presented to achieve capacity enhancement. Comparative analysis with perfect classical channel replacement is performed. Structural criterion on noisy channel is identified and connection to Kochen-Specker contextuality is established.

Result: Demonstrated superadditivity of one-shot zero-error classical capacity: joint use enables transmission of strictly more messages than permitted by product of individual capacities. Replacing perfect quantum channel with perfect classical channel eliminates the effect. Quantum advantage is shown to be rooted in Kochen-Specker contextuality.

Conclusion: Quantum channels provide genuine advantage over classical channels in enhancing communication capacity when used in parallel with noisy classical channels. This quantum advantage is fundamentally linked to contextuality, establishing a connection between quantum foundations and communication theory.

Abstract: We demonstrate superadditivity of one-shot zero-error classical capacity in an asymmetric communication setting where a noisy classical channel is used in parallel with a perfect quantum channel. Each channel individually supports only a fixed number of perfectly distinguishable messages. Their joint use enables transmission of strictly more messages than permitted by the product of the individual capacities. We present explicit constructions achieving this enhancement and establish that replacing the perfect quantum channel with a perfect classical channel eliminates the effect. Finally, we identify a structural criterion on the noisy channel governing this effect and show that the quantum advantage is rooted in Kochen-Specker contextuality.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Nondestructive measurement of molecular qubit internal states using Rydberg atoms via microwave dressing to enable simultaneous measurements with minimal crosstalk.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tweezer arrays of polar molecules offer quantum science opportunities, but current measurement schemes for internal states in bialkali molecules are destructive, limiting their utility for quantum information applications.

Method: Use Rydberg atoms to nondestructively measure molecular qubit internal states via microwave dressing of both molecules and Rydberg atoms, tuning interactions to minimize Rydberg-Rydberg interactions and enable simultaneous measurements.

Result: Demonstrated method for detecting specific molecular species (²³Na¹³³Cs and ⁸⁷Rb¹³³Cs) using ¹³³Cs atoms, with strategies developed to mitigate various sources of crosstalk.

Conclusion: Rydberg atoms provide a viable approach for nondestructive measurement of molecular qubit internal states, addressing a major challenge in bialkali molecule platforms and enabling new quantum information applications.

Abstract: Tweezer arrays of polar molecules present new opportunities for quantum science and quantum information. However, a major challenge, especially in bialkali molecule platforms, is the fact that current measurement schemes for the internal states are destructive. In this work, we present a method to use Rydberg atoms to nondestructively measure the internal state of a molecular qubit. We achieve this via microwave dressing of both molecules and Rydberg atoms, allowing us to tune the interactions so that there are minimal Rydberg-Rydberg interactions and many measurements can take place simultaneously. We consider two experimentally-motivated examples of detecting $^{23}$Na$^{133}$Cs and $^{87}$Rb$^{133}$Cs with $^{133}$Cs atoms. Finally, we discuss several strategies for mitigating various sources of crosstalk.

*Emmanuel Zambrini Cruzeiro,Junior R. Gonzales-Ureta,Raman Choudhary,Hugo Abreu,Adán Cabello,Sébastien Designolle*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: ENS boxes are extremal non-signaling correlations that violate quantum principles but are useful for studying Bell nonlocality. The paper obtains ENS boxes in arbitrary bipartite Bell scenarios, provides complete lists for unexplored scenarios, and uses them to address foundational questions about exclusivity principles, Specker's principle, magic square decomposition, and communication simulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ENS boxes are nonphysical according to quantum theory but are crucial for addressing problems in Bell nonlocality. The paper aims to systematically obtain ENS boxes in arbitrary bipartite Bell scenarios and use them to revisit foundational questions about quantum principles and correlations.

Method: The authors obtain ENS boxes in arbitrary bipartite Bell scenarios and present complete lists for several unexplored scenarios. They then use these boxes to analyze: 1) violation of exclusivity/local orthogonality and Specker's principles with two copies of any ENS box, 2) minimal decomposition of the magic square correlation in terms of ENS boxes, and 3) identification of minimal scenarios where communication is insufficient to simulate ENS boxes.

Result: 1) Complete lists of ENS boxes for unexplored Bell scenarios. 2) Two copies of any ENS box violate exclusivity and Specker's principles. 3) Minimal decomposition of the magic square correlation using ENS boxes. 4) Identification of minimal scenario where d < 6 bits of communication cannot simulate ENS boxes.

Conclusion: The ENS boxes approach provides new results and opens new research avenues in Bell nonlocality, demonstrating that these nonphysical correlations can yield insights into quantum principles, correlation structures, and communication requirements for simulating nonlocal correlations.

Abstract: Extremal non-signaling (ENS) boxes are correlations that correspond to vertices of the non-signaling polytope of a Bell scenario. Neither quantum theory nor any theory for ideal measurements allows for ENS boxes. That is, according to quantum theory, ENS boxes are nonphysical. Still, ENS boxes are crucial for addressing a number of problems in Bell nonlocality. Here, we obtain ENS boxes in arbitrary bipartite Bell scenarios and present the complete list of ENS boxes for several unexplored scenarios. Equipped with the boxes, we revisit several foundational questions. We find that already two copies of any ENS box violate the exclusivity (or local orthogonality) and Specker's principles. We provide the minimal decomposition of the magic square correlation - the simplest known perfect correlation in nature - in terms of ENS boxes. We identify the minimal scenario in which a dit of communication (with d < 6) is insufficient to simulate ENS boxes. Our results show that the ENS boxes approach leads to new results and opens new avenues for research.

### [6] [Plutarch: Toward Scalable Operational Parallelism on Racetrack-Shaped Trapped-Ion Processors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08930)
*Enhyeok Jang,Hyungseok Kim,Yongju Lee,Jaewon Kwon,Yipeng Huang,Won Woo Ro*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Quantum racetrack processor shows certified randomness advantage but suffers runtime degradation when expanding zones due to increased ion circulation overhead; Plutarch framework improves efficiency via unitary decomposition, prioritized gate execution, and shortcut paths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper investigates execution efficiency of quantum racetrack processors for general-purpose programs, motivated by recent demonstrations of quantum advantage in certified randomness on this architecture. The research aims to understand and address performance degradation issues when scaling the architecture by increasing zones.

Method: The Plutarch framework employs three key strategies: (1) unitary decomposition and translation to maximize zone utilization, (2) prioritizing execution of nearby gates over ion circulation to reduce overhead, and (3) implementing shortcuts to provide alternative paths for more efficient quantum operations.

Result: Evaluations using variational programs reveal that expanding zones counterintuitively degrades runtime performance under existing scheduling policies due to increased track length and ion circulation overhead, which offsets parallelism benefits. Plutarch mitigates this degradation through its optimization strategies.

Conclusion: The quantum racetrack architecture requires careful optimization strategies like Plutarch to achieve scalable performance for general-purpose quantum programs, as naive zone expansion can degrade runtime efficiency despite increased parallelism potential.

Abstract: A recent advancement in quantum computing shows a quantum advantage of certified randomness on the racetrack processor. This work investigates the execution efficiency of this architecture for general-purpose programs. We first explore the impact of increasing zones on runtime efficiency. Counterintuitively, our evaluations using variational programs reveal that expanding zones may degrade runtime performance under the existing scheduling policy. This degradation may be attributed to the increase in track length, which increases ion circulation overhead, offsetting the benefits of enhanced parallelism. To mitigate this, the proposed \textit{Plutarch} exploits 3 strategies: (i) unitary decomposition and translation to maximize zone utilization, (ii) prioritizing the execution of nearby gates over ion circulation, and (iii) implementing shortcuts to provide the alternative path.

### [8] [Obfuscation of Arbitrary Quantum Circuits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08969)
*Miryam Mi-Ying Huang,Er-Cheng Tang*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: First quantum ideal obfuscation scheme for arbitrary quantum circuits with quantum inputs/outputs, assuming post-quantum one-way functions, resolving key open problems in quantum cryptography.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior quantum obfuscation schemes only worked for pseudo-deterministic functions or unitary transformations, leaving general quantum circuits (including state preparation and error-correction) unaddressed. This work aims to solve the central open problem of obfuscating arbitrary quantum circuits.

Method: Constructs quantum ideal obfuscation in the classical oracle model using post-quantum one-way functions. Introduces novel primitive: subspace-preserving strong pseudorandom unitary (spsPRU) that fixes vectors in subspace S while acting as Haar random unitary on orthogonal complement S⊥. Can be realized in quantumly accessible pseudorandom oracle model using enhanced classical obfuscation schemes.

Result: First quantum ideal obfuscation scheme for arbitrary quantum circuits supporting quantum inputs/outputs, resolving open problems from Bartusek et al. (STOC 2023, 2024) and Huang & Tang (FOCS 2025). Scheme works in classical oracle model with post-quantum one-way functions.

Conclusion: Successfully constructs quantum ideal obfuscation for arbitrary quantum circuits, overcoming limitations of prior work. Introduces spsPRU primitive as core technical innovation. Scheme can be instantiated in quantumly accessible pseudorandom oracle model using enhanced classical obfuscation, providing practical realization path.

Abstract: Program obfuscation aims to conceal a program's internal structure while preserving its functionality. A central open problem is whether an obfuscation scheme for arbitrary quantum circuits exists. Despite several efforts having been made toward this goal, prior works have succeeded only in obfuscating quantum circuits that implement either pseudo-deterministic functions or unitary transformations. Although unitary transformations already include a broad class of quantum computation, many important quantum tasks, such as state preparation and quantum error-correction, go beyond unitaries and fall within general completely positive trace-preserving maps.
  In this work, we construct the first quantum ideal obfuscation scheme for arbitrary quantum circuits that support quantum inputs and outputs in the classical oracle model assuming post-quantum one-way functions, thereby resolving an open problem posed in Bartusek et al. (STOC 2023), Bartusek, Brakerski, and Vaikuntanathan (STOC 2024), and Huang and Tang (FOCS 2025). At the core of our construction lies a novel primitive that we introduce, called the subspace-preserving strong pseudorandom unitary (spsPRU). An spsPRU is a family of efficient unitaries that fix every vector in a given linear subspace $S$, while acting as a Haar random unitary on the orthogonal complement $S^\perp$ under both forward and inverse oracle queries. Furthermore, by instantiating the classical oracle model with the ideal obfuscation scheme for classical circuits proposed by Jain et al. (CRYPTO 2023) and later enhanced by Bartusek et al. (arxiv:2510.05316), our obfuscation scheme can also be realized in the quantumly accessible pseudorandom oracle model.

### [9] [Collective inhibition of light scattering from atoms into an optical cavity at a magic frequency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08978)
*Á. Kurkó,B. Gábor,D. Varga,A. Simon,T. Barmashova,A. Dombi,T. W. Clark,F. I. B. Williams,D. Nagy,A. Vukics,P. Domokos*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Observation of a new magic frequency in ⁸⁷Rb D2 line where light scattering into a cavity is suppressed by quantum interference and collective atom-cavity coupling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate quantum interference effects in strongly coupled atom-cavity systems and identify frequencies where scattering processes are suppressed, which could enable better control of light-matter interactions for quantum information applications.

Method: Measured scattering from laser-driven cold ⁸⁷Rb atoms into a high-finesse cavity in a polarization-sensitive way, analyzing both Rayleigh and Raman scattering processes into near-resonant cavity modes across different frequency detunings.

Result: Found a magic frequency at -185 MHz below F=2↔F'=3 transition where both Rayleigh and Raman scattering are extinguished due to quantum interference in polariton excitations. Also identified a second magic frequency at -506 MHz where only Raman scattering is suppressed via single-atom quantum interference.

Conclusion: Demonstrated that quantum interference effects in strongly coupled atom-cavity systems can lead to complete suppression of scattering at specific magic frequencies, with different mechanisms (collective polariton interference vs single-atom interference) responsible for different suppression patterns.

Abstract: We report on the observation of a new magic frequency within the hyperfine structure of the D2 line of ${}^{87}$Rb atoms at which the scattering of light into a high-finesse cavity is suppressed by an interplay between quantum interference and the strong collective coupling of atoms to the cavity. Scattering from a cloud of laser-driven cold atoms into the cavity was measured in a polarization sensitive way. We have found that both the Rayleigh and Raman scattering processes into the near-resonant cavity modes are extinguished at 185 MHz below the F=2$\leftrightarrow$F'=3 transition frequency. This coincidence together with the shape of the observed spectral dip imply that the effect relies on a quantum interference in the polariton excitations of the strongly coupled combined atom-photon system. We have also demonstrated the existence of a magic frequency around -506 MHz, where only the Raman scattering is suppressed due to a quantum interference effect at the single-atom level.

### [10] [Impact of control signal phase noise on qubit fidelity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09014)
*Agata Barsotti,Paolo Marconcini,Gregorio Procissi,Massimo Macucci*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper analyzes how phase noise in control signals degrades qubit fidelity in quantum computing, using numerical simulations with Qiskit-Dynamics to quantify fidelity loss and identify spectral contributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As qubit decoherence times improve and readout technologies advance, phase noise in drive signals becomes a growing limitation to achieving high fidelity in complex quantum control pulse sequences.

Method: Numerical simulations using Qiskit-Dynamics with phase noise realizations generated from given power spectral densities, comparing final states from noisy vs ideal pulse sequences and averaging over multiple noise realizations.

Result: The study quantifies fidelity degradation caused by phase noise and identifies contributions from different spectral components of phase fluctuations using an approximate analytical representation.

Conclusion: Phase noise in reference oscillators represents a significant fidelity limitation that must be addressed as quantum control systems advance, with spectral analysis providing insights for mitigation strategies.

Abstract: As qubit decoherence times are increased and readout technologies are improved, nonidealities in the drive signals, such as phase noise, are going to represent a growing limitation to the fidelity achievable at the end of complex control pulse sequencies. Here we study the impact on fidelity of phase noise affecting reference oscillators with the help of numerical simulations, which allow us to directly take into account the interaction between the phase fluctuations in the control signals and the evolution of the qubit state. Our method is based on the generation of phase noise realizations consistent with a given power spectral density, that are then applied to the pulse carrier in simulations, with Qiskit-Dynamics, of the qubit temporal evolution. By comparing the final state obtained at the end of a noisy pulse sequence with that in the ideal case and averaging over multiple noise realizations, we estimate the resulting degradation in fidelity, and exploiting an approximate analytical representation of a carrier affected by phase fluctuations, we discuss the contributions of the different spectral components of phase noise.

Result: The universal electromagnetic contribution to Casimir interaction in salted water extends to longer ranges than previously thought and dominates non-universal contributions at distances relevant to actin fibers within cells.

Conclusion: The universal Casimir effect has significant implications at the cellular scale, particularly for understanding interactions between biological structures like actin fibers in salted water environments.

Abstract: The Casimir interaction in salted water contains a universal contribution of electromagnetic fluctuations that makes it of a longer range than previously thought. The universal contribution dominates non universal ones at the distances relevant for actin fibers inside the cell. We discuss universal and non-universal contributions with a model mimicking biological matter. We also show that the universal Casimir effect should have important implications at the cell scale.

*Ian Haines,Arshath Manjalingal,Logan Blackham,Saeed Rahamanian Koshkaki,Arkajit Mandal*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Exciton-polariton relaxation from upper to lower polariton involves two-step mechanism: vertical inter-band transition followed by phonon-induced Fröhlich scattering, with suppression in finite-thickness materials due to phonon-fluctuation synchronization from polaritonic spatial delocalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite exciton-polaritons being promising for quantum technologies and material engineering, the fundamental mechanistic principles governing their dynamics and relaxation remain poorly understood, particularly the microscopic details of relaxation processes following upper polariton excitation.

Method: Combined mixed quantum-classical simulations and analytical analysis to investigate exciton-polariton relaxation mechanisms, focusing on phonon-induced transitions from upper to lower polariton states.

Result: Revealed two-step relaxation mechanism: 1) vertical inter-band transition from upper to lower polariton, 2) phonon-induced Fröhlich scattering within lower polariton. Found significant suppression of phonon-induced polaritonic intraband Fröhlich scattering in finite-thickness materials due to phonon-fluctuation synchronization caused by polaritonic spatial delocalization in quantization direction.

Conclusion: Phonon fluctuation-synchronization plays central role across polaritonic relaxation pathways, with derived analytical expressions relating material finite thickness to relaxation rate constants, providing microscopic mechanistic understanding of exciton-polariton relaxation dynamics.

Abstract: Exciton-polaritons are light-matter hybrid quasi-particles that have emerged as a flexible platform for developing quantum technologies and engineering material properties. However, the fundamental mechanistic principles that govern their dynamics and relaxation remain elusive. In this work, we provide the microscopic mechanistic understanding of the exciton-polariton relaxation process that follows from an excitation in the upper polariton. Using both mixed quantum-classical simulations and analytical analysis, we reveal that phonon-induced upper-to-lower polariton relaxation proceeds via two steps: the first step is a vertical inter-band transition from the upper to the lower polariton, which is followed by a second step that is a phonon-induced Fröhlich scattering within the lower polariton. We find that in materials of finite thickness (which include filled cavities), phonon-induced polaritonic intraband Fröhlich scattering is significantly suppressed. We show that the microscopic origin of this suppression is phonon-fluctuations synchronization (or self-averaging) due to the polaritonic spatial delocalization in the quantization direction. Finally, we show that the same phonon fluctuation-synchronization effect plays a central role across polaritonic relaxation pathways, and we derive simple analytical expressions that relate a material's finite thickness to the corresponding relaxation rate constants.

*Enhao Bai,Jian Peng,Tianyi Wu,Kai Wen,Fengkai Sun,Chun Zhou,Yaping Li,Zhenrong Zhang,Chen Dong*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A displacement-squeeze receiver (DSR) for discriminating BPSK displaced squeezed vacuum states achieves error probabilities between the Helstrom bound and twice that bound, beating standard quantum limits at low energies and showing robustness to various non-idealities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an improved receiver for discriminating binary phase-shift keyed displaced squeezed vacuum states (S-BPSK) that can surpass standard quantum limits at low signal energies while maintaining robustness against practical non-idealities.

Method: The receiver applies a displacement followed by a squeezing operation with the squeezing axis rotated by π/2, then performs photon-number-resolving detection with a maximum a posteriori (MAP) threshold decision. This processing elongates state distance in phase space and reduces population overlap in Fock basis.

Result: For all signal energy N, the error probability lies between the Helstrom bound and twice that bound. DSR beats the S-BPSK standard quantum limit at N≈0.3, drops below the coherent-state BPSK Helstrom bound at N≈0.4, and achieves P_err<1% near N≈0.6. The receiver shows robustness to non-unit efficiency, dark counts, phase diffusion, and thermal noise when using MAP threshold adaptation.

Conclusion: The displacement-squeeze receiver provides a practical approach for discriminating S-BPSK states that outperforms standard quantum limits at low energies, approaches theoretical bounds, and maintains performance under realistic experimental imperfections through adaptive thresholding.

Abstract: We propose a displacement-squeeze receiver (DSR) for discriminating BPSK displaced squeezed vacuum states (S-BPSK). The receiver applies a displacement followed by a squeezing operation with the squeezing axis rotated by $\fracπ{2}$, and performs photon-number-resolving detection with a MAP threshold decision. This processing effectively increases the distinguishability of the input states by elongating their distance in phase space and reducing their population overlap in Fock basis. We show that for all signal energy N, $P_\text{err}^\text{DSR} \in \left[P_\text{HB}^\text{DSS}, 2P_\text{HB}^\text{DSS}\right]$, under equal priors and ideal condition. In the low-energy regime, DSR beats the S-BPSK SQL at $N \approx 0.3$ and drops below the coherent-state BPSK (C-BPSK) Helstrom bound at $N \approx 0.4$, reaching $P_\text{err}^\text{DSR} < 1\%$ near $N \approx 0.6$. Finally, we quantify performance under non-unit efficiency and dark counts, phase diffusion, and receiver thermal noise, with MAP threshold adaptation providing robustness across these nonidealities.

Starting from the Nakajima--Zwanzig formalism, we vectorize the reduced density matrix into a four-dimensional state vector and cast the dynamics as a Volterra integro-differential equation with an operator-valued memory kernel. The learning task is then formulated as a constrained optimization problem over the admissible operator space, where correlation functions are approximated by rational functions using Padé approximants. We establish well-posedness of the learnin

Conclusion: SASHMAG enables precision high-field magnetometry with validated simulation framework that can generate synthetic training datasets for future ML-enhanced autonomous magnetometry in demanding applications.

Abstract: We present SASHMAG (Saturated Absorption Spectroscopy High-field MAGnetometer), an atomic sensor designed for precision magnetic-field measurements in the intermediate-to-high field regime ($>0.2\,\text{T}$) using Rubidium-87 ($^{87}Rb$). The sensor operates in the hyperfine Paschen-Back regime, where the hyperfine and Zeeman interactions decouple, and utilizes counter-propagating pump-probe configuration in Faraday geometry to resolve isolated, Doppler-free Zeeman transitions. To interpret the resulting spectra in this strongly field-dependent regime, we developed a comprehensive multilevel optical Bloch-equation model solved explicitly in the uncoupled $\ket{m_I, m_J}$ basis, capturing state mixing and nonlinear saturation dynamics. This model reproduces measured spectra at sub-Doppler resolution and is consistent with analytical expectations for power broadening and thermal Doppler scaling. Magnetic field estimation is performed using a physics-constrained optimization routine that infers the magnetic field by minimizing the residual between experimentally extracted line centers and calculated transition frequencies from the field-dependent Hamiltonian. We demonstrate magnetic field retrieval from $0.2\,\text{T}$ to $0.4\,\text{T}$ with a precision of $\pm 0.0017 \,\text{T}$). Furthermore, the validated simulation establishes a foundation for generating synthetic training datasets, paving the way for autonomous, Machine Learning-enhanced magnetometry in applications ranging from MRI to fusion reactors.

*Xu Zhou,Wenxuan Tao,Keren Li,Shenggen Zheng*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: DEQAAA is a distributed quantum algorithm for exact amplitude amplification of arbitrary quantum states across multiple nodes, achieving significant resource savings in gate count and circuit depth compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome physical limitations of single-device quantum architectures in the NISQ era and enable scalable quantum information processing through distributed quantum computation, specifically addressing the challenge of exact amplitude amplification for quantum states with arbitrary amplitude distributions.

Method: Proposes a Distributed Exact Quantum Amplitude Amplification Algorithm (DEQAAA) that supports partitioning across any number of nodes (2 ≤ t ≤ n), with qubit distribution across nodes satisfying ∑n_j = n. The method decomposes C^{n-1}PS gates to reduce quantum gate count and circuit depth, and is validated using MindSpore Quantum simulation software.

Result: DEQAAA demonstrates remarkable advantages in quantum gate count and circuit depth scaling, achieving over 97% reduction in both indicators compared to QAAA and EQAAA in 10-qubit scenarios. The algorithm successfully performs exact amplitude amplification for multiple targets (8 and 14 in decimal) across 4, 6, 8, and 10-qubit systems.

Conclusion: DEQAAA provides an efficient distributed solution for exact amplitude amplification with arbitrary amplitude distributions, offering significant resource savings and enhanced noise resilience that makes it particularly suitable for NISQ-era quantum computing applications.

Abstract: In the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era, distributed quantum computation has garnered considerable interest, as it overcomes the physical limitations of single-device architectures and enables scalable quantum information processing. In this study, we focus on the challenge of achieving exact amplitude amplification for quantum states with arbitrary amplitude distributions and subsequently propose a Distributed Exact Quantum Amplitude Amplification Algorithm (DEQAAA). Specifically, (1) it supports partitioning across any number of nodes $t$ within the range $2 \leq t \leq n$; (2) the maximum qubit count required for any single node is expressed as $\max \left(n_0,n_1,\dots,n_{t-1} \right) $, where $n_j$ represents the number of qubits at the $j$-th node, with $\sum_{j=0}^{t-1} n_j =n$; (3) it can realize exact amplitude amplification for multiple targets of a quantum state with arbitrary amplitude distributions; (4) we verify the effectiveness of DEQAAA by resolving a specific exact amplitude amplification task involving two targets (8 and 14 in decimal) via MindSpore Quantum, a quantum simulation software, with tests conducted on 4-qubit, 6-qubit, 8-qubit and 10-qubit systems. Notably, through the decomposition of $C^{n-1}PS$ gates, DEQAAA demonstrates remarkable advantages in both quantum gate count and circuit depth as the qubit number scales, thereby boosting its noise resilience. In the 10-qubit scenario, for instance, it achieves a reduction of over $97\%$ in both indicators compared to QAAA and EQAAA, underscoring its outstanding resource-saving performance.

*Chao Zhang,Zipeng Wu,Jiahui Wu,Shilin Huang*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A bidirectional decoder for concatenated quantum Hamming codes achieves polynomial-time decoding with improved error thresholds and better logical-error suppression compared to local decoders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Concatenated quantum codes offer a pathway to fault-tolerant quantum computation, but existing decoders don't fully exploit their error-correction capability. Conventional local decoding has limitations in performance.

Method: Introduces a hard-decision decoder with polynomial time complexity that uses bidirectional decoding - leveraging higher-level syndrome information to revise lower-level recovery decisions for concatenated quantum Hamming codes.

Result: For the concatenated [[15,7,3]] quantum Hamming code under independent bit-flip noise, the bidirectional decoder improves the threshold from ~1.56% to 4.35% compared to standard local decoding. The decoder preserves full 3^L code-distance scaling for at least three concatenation levels, outperforming the 2^{L+1} scaling of local decoders.

Conclusion: The bidirectional decoder enhances the competitiveness of concatenated-code architectures for low-overhead fault-tolerant quantum computation by providing better error suppression with polynomial-time decoding.

Abstract: High-rate concatenated quantum codes offer a promising pathway toward fault-tolerant quantum computation, yet designing efficient decoders that fully exploit their error-correction capability remains a significant challenge. In this work, we introduce a hard-decision decoder for concatenated quantum Hamming codes with time complexity polynomial in the block length. This decoder overcomes the limitations of conventional local decoding by leveraging higher-level syndrome information to revise lower-level recovery decisions -- a strategy we refer to as bidirectional decoding. For the concatenated $[[15,7,3]]$ quantum Hamming code under independent bit-flip noise, the bidirectional decoder improves the threshold from approximately $1.56\%$ to $4.35\%$ compared with standard local decoding. Moreover, the decoder empirically preserves the full $3^{L}$ code-distance scaling for at least three levels of concatenation, resulting in substantially faster logical-error suppression than the $2^{L+1}$ scaling offered by local decoders. Our results can enhance the competitiveness of concatenated-code architectures for low-overhead fault-tolerant quantum computation.

*Ying Zhang,Lijun Ji*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper proves that for quantum Latin squares of order 6m, cardinalities covering almost all integers from 6m to 36m² (except 6m+1) are achievable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To characterize the possible cardinalities (number of distinct vectors) in quantum Latin squares of composite orders, specifically focusing on orders that are multiples of 6.

Method: Uses sub-QLS(6) constructions and combinatorial techniques to build QLS(6m) with various cardinalities, covering the interval [6m, 36m²] except for the single value 6m+1.

Result: For any integer m ≥ 2 and any c ∈ [6m, 36m²] \ {6m+1}, there exists a QLS(6m) with cardinality c, establishing a near-complete characterization of achievable cardinalities.

Conclusion: The cardinality spectrum for QLS(6m) is almost complete, with only one gap at 6m+1, demonstrating rich combinatorial structure in quantum Latin squares of composite orders.

Abstract: A quantum Latin square of order $n$ (denoted as QLS$(n)$) is an $n\times n$ array whose entries are unit column vectors from the $n$-dimensional Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_n$, such that each row and column forms an orthonormal basis. Two unit vectors $|u\rangle, |v\rangle\in \mathcal{H}_n$ are regarded as identical if there exists a real number $θ$ such that $|u\rangle=e^{iθ}|v\rangle$; otherwise, they are considered distinct. The cardinality $c$ of a QLS$(n)$ is the number of distinct vectors in the array. In this note,we use sub-QLS$(6)$ to prove that for any integer $m\geq 2$ and any $c\in [6m,36m^2]\setminus \{6m+1\}$, there is a QLS$(6m)$ with cardinality $c$.

TL;DR: QLA algorithm simulates oblique scattering of Gaussian pulses at dielectric interface, showing energy conservation and Huygens-like wavefronts in transmitted pulse.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study time-dependent evolution of electromagnetic fields from oblique scattering of bounded pulses at infinite planar dielectric interface using a unitary algorithm that conserves energy.

Method: Uses qubit lattice algorithm (QLA), an initial value algorithm that is almost fully unitary, to simulate scattering of various Gaussian envelope pulses at incident angles below total internal reflection threshold.

Result: Excellent conservation of electromagnetic energy due to QLA's unitarity. Reflected pulse retains Gaussian shape while transmitted pulse shows combination of Gaussian envelope with Huygens-like emitted wavefronts from collision point, with strength dependent on incident pulse width.

Conclusion: QLA effectively models pulse scattering at dielectric interfaces, revealing complex transmitted pulse structure with Huygens wavefronts that depend on incident pulse characteristics, while maintaining energy conservation through its unitary nature.

Abstract: An initial value algorithm is utilized to examine the time dependent evolution of the electromagnetic fields arising from oblique scattering of bounded pulses from an infinite planar dielectric interface. Since the qubit lattice algorithm (QLA) is almost fully unitary, one finds excellent conservation of electromagnetic energy. Various Gaussian envelope pulses are considered in regimes where the incident angle is below that needed for total internal reflection. While the reflected pulse retains its overall Gaussian shape, the transmitted pulse exhibits a combination of a Gaussian envelope along with Huygen-like emitted wave fronts from the collision point of the initial pulse with the infinite dielectric interface. The strength of these Huygen wavefronts depends on the width of the incident pulse.

TL;DR: Unified theory of two-photon dark-state laser cooling for trapped ions identifies ion-number-dependent crossover between weak and strong coupling regimes, with analytic results for both limits and collective effects in strong coupling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a comprehensive theoretical framework for understanding and optimizing two-photon dark-state laser cooling, which is essential for preparing trapped ions near their motional ground state for scalable quantum technologies.

Method: Developed a unified many-body theory for ions with Λ level structure driven by Raman lasers, analyzing both weak and strong coupling regimes through analytic derivations and comparing with exact numerical simulations.

Result: Identified ion-number-dependent crossover between weak and strong coupling where cooling rate and final temperature are simultaneously optimized. In weak coupling, cooling parameters are ion-number independent; in strong coupling, collective phonon exchange between dark and bright states enhances cooling rate with increasing ion number.

Conclusion: The theory provides experimentally accessible guidelines for optimizing cooling in large ion crystals, advancing scalable trapped-ion quantum technologies through improved ground-state preparation.

Abstract: We develop a unified many-body theory of two-photon dark-state laser cooling, the workhorse for preparing trapped ions close to their motional quantum ground state. For ions with a $Λ$ level structure, driven by Raman lasers, we identify an ion-number-dependent crossover between weak and strong coupling where both the cooling rate and final temperature are simultaneously optimized. We obtain simple analytic results in both extremes: In the weak coupling limit, we show a Lorentzian spin-absorption spectrum determines the cooling rate and final occupation of the motional state, which are both independent of the number of ions. We also highlight the benefit of including an additional spin dependent force in this case. In the strong coupling regime, our theory reveals the role of collective dynamics arising from phonon exchange between dark and bright states, allowing us to explain the enhancement of the cooling rate with increasing ion number. Our analytic results agree closely with exact numerical simulations and provide experimentally accessible guidelines for optimizing cooling in large ion crystals, a key step toward scalable, high-fidelity trapped-ion quantum technologies.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper investigates higher-order quantum correlations in entangled hyperon-antihyperon systems, formulating a new Clauser-Horne inequality for statistical cumulants and finding significant third-order violations that can be observed in experiments like BESIII and Belle II.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While linear properties of quantum nonlocality have been extensively studied through various inequalities, the vast higher-order regime remains unexplored. The authors aim to investigate higher-order quantum correlations in entangled hyperon-antihyperon systems generated in charmonium decays.

Method: The authors formulate a new type of Clauser-Horne inequality for statistical cumulants and central moments. They apply this framework to analyze higher-order correlations in hyperon-antihyperon systems, specifically focusing on Λ\barΛ pairs generated in high-energy physics experiments.

Result: The study finds significant violation of the third-order constraint in hyperon-antihyperon systems, indicating the existence of higher-order quantum correlations. The violation is more pronounced in higher energy systems of Λ\barΛ pairs, particularly against kinematic contamination of timelike events.

Conclusion: Higher-order quantum correlations exist in entangled hyperon-antihyperon systems and can be observed in high-energy physics experiments like BESIII and Belle II. The third-order violation provides evidence for unexplored aspects of quantum nonlocality beyond linear properties.

Abstract: Nonlocality is a peculiar nature of quanta and it stands as an important quantum resource in application. Yet mere linear property of it, viz. the first order in moment, has been explored through various inequalities. Noticing the vast higher-order regime unexplored, in this study we investigate the higher-order quantum correlations in entangled hyperon-antihyperon system, which may be generated massively in charmonium decays. A new type of Clauser-Horne inequality for statistical cumulants and central moments is formulated. We find that a significant violation of the third-order constraint, indicating the existence of higher-order correlation, exists in hyperon-antihyperon system and can be observed in high energy physics experiments, like BESIII and Belle II. Notably, the violation manifests more in higher energy systems of the $Λ\barΛ$ pair against the kinematic contamination of timelike events.

TL;DR: Continuous scale invariance in quantum mechanics can break to discrete phase invariance, not just discrete scale invariance, with examples including one-body problems with inverse-square potentials and few-body problems with magnetic fluxes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore alternative symmetry breaking patterns of continuous scale invariance beyond the well-known Efimov effect (breakdown to discrete scale invariance), specifically investigating the possibility of breaking to discrete phase invariance.

Method: Revisits the one-body problem on half line with inverse-square potential as simplest scale-invariant quantum mechanics; analyzes S-matrix poles; examines three few-body problems: one-body Aharonov-Bohm problem, two-body problem of nonidentical particles in 2D, and three-body problem of nonidentical particles in 1D, all containing codimension-two magnetic fluxes in configuration spaces.

Result: Shows continuous scale invariance can break to discrete phase invariance in a small window of coupling constant for inverse-square potential; demonstrates discrete phase invariance manifests as circularly distributed simple poles on Riemann sheets of S-matrix; presents three concrete few-body examples exhibiting this symmetry breaking pattern.

Conclusion: Discrete phase invariance represents a novel symmetry breaking pattern of continuous scale invariance in quantum mechanics, distinct from the Efimov effect, with manifestations in various few-body systems containing magnetic fluxes in configuration spaces.

Abstract: Scale invariance in quantum mechanics can be broken in several ways. A well-known example is the breakdown of continuous scale invariance to discrete scale invariance, whose typical realization is the Efimov effect of three-body problems. Here we discuss yet another discrete symmetry to which continuous scale invariance can be broken: discrete phase invariance. We first revisit the one-body problem on the half line in the presence of an inverse-square potential -- the simplest example of nontrivial scale-invariant quantum mechanics -- and show that continuous scale invariance can be broken to discrete phase invariance in a small window of coupling constant. We also show that discrete phase invariance manifests itself as circularly distributed simple poles on Riemann sheets of the S-matrix. We then present three examples of few-body problems that exhibit discrete phase invariance. These examples are the one-body Aharonov-Bohm problem, a two-body problem of nonidentical particles in two dimensions, and a three-body problem of nonidentical particles in one dimension, all of which contain a codimension-two ``magnetic'' flux in configuration spaces.

TL;DR: A geometric hybrid Poincaré sphere (GHPS) framework for structured photon states with independent control of spin and orbital angular momentum, enabling spatially inhomogeneous polarization and intensity patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitation of conventional higher-order Poincaré spheres where spin angular momentum (SAM) and orbital angular momentum (OAM) are intrinsically coupled through fixed basis states, requiring a more flexible geometrical framework.

Method: Construct GHPS by defining poles as direct products of arbitrary orthogonal bases on Poincaré sphere (PS) and orbital Poincaré sphere (OPS), then superposing these pole states. Use numerical simulations to analyze representative GHPS states.

Result: GHPS spherical coordinates govern amplitude ratio and relative phase between pole bases, enabling spatially inhomogeneous polarization distributions and intensity patterns, including nonseparable structures where polarization and intensity are intrinsically intertwined.

Conclusion: GHPS provides a systematic state-space description for coherent geometrical control of advanced structured light fields with independent SAM and OAM manipulation.

Abstract: We propose a geometric hybrid Poincaré sphere (GHPS) as a unified geometrical framework for describing structured photon states with independently controllable spin angular momentum (SAM) and orbital angular momentum (OAM). Unlike the conventional higher-order Poincaré sphere, in which the SAM and OAM are intrinsically coupled through fixed basis states, the GHPS is constructed by defining its poles as direct products of arbitrary orthogonal bases on the Poincaré sphere (PS) and orbital Poincaré sphere (OPS) and by superposing these pole states. Using numerical simulations, we analyze representative GHPS states and show that the GHPS spherical coordinates govern the amplitude ratio and relative phase between the pole bases. This framework enables spatially inhomogeneous polarization distributions and intensity patterns, including nonseparable structures in which polarization and intensity are intrinsically intertwined, and provides a systematic state-space description for the coherent geometrical control of advanced structured light fields.

*Geng Liu,Masahito Hayashi*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces a posteriori certification for the generalized quantum Arimoto-Blahut algorithm, enabling convergence verification directly from computed iterates rather than requiring difficult-to-verify a priori assumptions, with application to computing quantum relative entropy of channels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing convergence guarantees for the generalized quantum Arimoto-Blahut algorithm rely on analytical conditions that are either overly restrictive or difficult to verify for concrete problems, limiting its broader application in quantum information theory.

Method: Introduces an a posteriori certification approach with a generalized global convergence theorem requiring convexity and a numerically verifiable condition, enabling certification by checking explicit inequalities along computed trajectories. Applies this to develop a certified iterative scheme for computing quantum relative entropy of channels.

Result: Proves generalized global convergence theorem for QAB iteration under weaker numerically verifiable conditions, develops practical certification procedure, and demonstrates rapid convergence with improved scalability and adaptivity compared to SDP-based approaches in numerical experiments.

Conclusion: The a posteriori certification framework overcomes key limitations of the QAB algorithm, making it more practical for quantum information applications, particularly for computing quantum relative entropy of channels where it avoids bottlenecks of gradient-based and SDP methods.

Abstract: The generalized quantum Arimoto--Blahut (QAB) algorithm is a powerful derivative-free iterative method in quantum information theory. A key obstacle to its broader use is that existing convergence guarantees typically rely on analytical conditions that are either overly restrictive or difficult to verify for concrete problems. We address this issue by introducing an a posteriori certification viewpoint: instead of requiring fully a priori verifiable assumptions, we provide convergence and error guarantees that can be validated directly from the iterates produced by the algorithm. Specifically, we prove a generalized global convergence theorem showing that, under convexity and a substantially weaker numerically verifiable condition, the QAB iteration converges to the global minimizer. This theorem yields a practical certification procedure: by checking explicit inequalities along the computed trajectory, one can certify global optimality and bound the suboptimality of the obtained value. As an application, we develop a certified iterative scheme for computing the quantum relative entropy of channels, a fundamental measure of distinguishability in quantum dynamics. This quantity is notoriously challenging to evaluate numerically: gradient-based methods are impeded by the complexity of matrix functions such as square roots and logarithms, while recent semidefinite programming approaches can become computationally and memory intensive at high precision. Our method avoids these bottlenecks by combining the QAB iteration with a posteriori certification, yielding an efficient and scalable algorithm. Numerical experiments demonstrate rapid convergence and improved scalability and adaptivity compared with SDP-based approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide an informational, timing-sensitive analysis of the CHSH inequality that avoids assuming an underlying probability space, and to reformulate quantum loopholes (locality and measurement-dependence/freedom-of-choice) as structural constraints in a game-theoretic framework.

Method: Using game-theoretic probability to construct a loopholes-closed sequential hidden-variable game between Scientists and Nature, with capital processes that test: (i) convergence of empirical conditional frequencies to CHSH correlations, and (ii) absence of systematic correlations between measurement settings and Nature's hidden-variable assignments.

Result: Proved that Nature cannot satisfy both conditions simultaneously: at least one capital process must diverge, providing an operational winning strategy for Scientists and a game-theoretic probabilistic interpretation of experimentally observed CHSH violations.

Conclusion: The paper establishes a game-theoretic framework for analyzing CHSH violations that avoids probability space assumptions, reformulates quantum loopholes as structural game constraints, and provides an operational interpretation of experimental results through capital process divergence.

Abstract: We study the CHSH inequality from an informational, timing-sensitive viewpoint using game-theoretic probability, which avoids assuming an underlying probability space.

We construct a loopholes-closed game with capital processes that test (i) convergence of empirical conditional frequencies to the CHSH correlations and (ii) the absence of systematic correlations between measurement settings and Nature's hidden-variable assignments, and prove that Nature cannot satisfy both simultaneously: at least one capital process must diverge. This yields an operational winning strategy for Scientists and a game-theoretic probabilistic interpretation of experimentally observed CHSH violations.

Motivation: To investigate the crossover from integrability to chaos in quantum systems and establish a direct correspondence between Hamiltonian spectral correlations and local observables in the energy eigenbasis as a signature of ergodicity breaking, going beyond standard ETH indicators.

Method: Study the spin-1/2 XXZ chain with a local perturbation driving integrability to chaos; introduce a submatrix-based framework analyzing local observables in energy eigenbasis by extracting real-symmetric blocks along the diagonal; track standard ETH indicators and eigenstate entanglement entropy.

Result: Submatrices of local observables exhibit both short-range and long-range spectral features of the Hamiltonian; this correspondence persists in partially ergodic regimes, showing that emergence of chaos is encoded locally within observables' matrix structure and small blocks suffice to capture underlying spectral correlations.

Conclusion: The spectral correlations of local observables in the energy eigenbasis directly reflect the Hamiltonian's spectral properties, providing a signature of ergodicity breaking; small submatrices are sufficient to capture these features, indicating that chaos emergence is locally encoded within observables' matrix structure.

Abstract: The Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis explains thermalization in isolated quantum systems through the statistical properties of observables in the energy eigenbasis. We investigate the crossover from integrability to chaos in the spin-$1/2$ XXZ chain, establishing a direct correspondence between the spectral correlations of the Hamiltonian and local observables expressed in the energy eigenbasis as a signature of ergodicity breaking. By introducing a local perturbation that drives the system from integrability to chaos, we track the standard ETH indicators and the eigenstate entanglement entropy. We introduce a submatrix-based framework for analyzing local observables in the energy eigenbasis. By extracting real-symmetric blocks along the diagonal of the local observables represented in eigenbasis, we show that these submatrices exhibit both the short-range and long-range spectral features of the Hamiltonian. Remarkably, this correspondence persists even in a partially ergodic regime, indicating that the emergence of chaos is already encoded locally within the observables' matrix structure and that small blocks are sufficient to capture the underlying spectral correlations.

Conclusion: MPS-based approximate encoding provides an effective approach for quantum data encoding that balances circuit depth with robustness, offering practical advantages for real-world QML applications on near-term quantum devices.

Abstract: One of the key considerations in the development of Quantum Machine Learning (QML) protocols is the encoding of classical data onto a quantum device. In this chapter we introduce the Matrix Product State representation of quantum systems and show how it may be used to construct circuits which encode a desired state. Putting this in the context of QML we show how this process may be modified to give a low depth approximate encoding and crucially that this encoding does not hinder classification accuracy and is indeed exhibits an increased robustness against classical adversarial attacks. This is illustrated by demonstrations of adversarially robust variational quantum classifiers for the MNIST and FMNIST dataset, as well as a small-scale experimental demonstration on a superconducting quantum device.

TL;DR: Proposes Network-Based Quantum Computation (NBQC) for distributed fault-tolerant quantum computing using many small-scale nodes, achieving better performance than circuit-based and measurement-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fault-tolerant quantum computing requires many physical qubits per logical qubit, limiting logical qubit capacity per node. Distributed fault-tolerant quantum computing (DFTQC) is needed for large-scale computation using small-scale nodes, but existing designs for nodes with only 1-2 logical qubits are insufficient.

Method: Proposes Network-Based Quantum Computation (NBQC) where computational data continuously moves through the network while maintaining connectivity between nodes. The approach specializes network structures to quantum program characteristics like peak access frequencies.

Result: Numerical simulations show NBQC achieves shorter execution times than circuit-based strategies and more node-efficient constructions than measurement-based quantum computing. Network specialization to program structures can significantly reduce the number of required nodes.

Conclusion: NBQC provides a foundation for designing DFTQC architectures that exploit the redundancy of many small fault-tolerant nodes, enabling efficient distributed quantum computation.

Abstract: In fault-tolerant quantum computing, a large number of physical qubits are required to construct a single logical qubit, and a single quantum node may be able to hold only a small number of logical qubits. In such a case, the idea of distributed fault-tolerant quantum computing (DFTQC) is important to demonstrate large-scale quantum computation using small-scale nodes. However, the design of distributed systems on small-scale nodes, where each node can store only one or a few logical qubits for computation, has not been explored well yet. In this paper, we propose network-based quantum computation (NBQC) to efficiently realize distributed fault-tolerant quantum computation using many small-scale nodes. A key idea of NBQC is to let computational data continuously move throughout the network while maintaining the connectivity to other nodes. We numerically show that, for practical benchmark tasks, our method achieves shorter execution times than circuit-based strategies and more node-efficient constructions than measurement-based quantum computing. Also, if we are allowed to specialize the network to the structure of quantum programs, such as peak access frequencies, the number of nodes can be significantly reduced. Thus, our methods provide a foundation in designing DFTQC architecture exploiting the redundancy of many small fault-tolerant nodes.

### [30] [Sparse quantum state preparation with improved Toffoli cost](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09388)
*Felix Rupprecht,Sabine Wölk*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Efficient preparation of sparse quantum states with reduced Toffoli gate count via optimized isometry implementation and joint optimization of dense-state preparation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sparse quantum states are fundamental for quantum simulation and linear-system solvers, but existing preparation methods are costly. There's a need to reduce the dominant Toffoli gate overhead in isometry implementation for sparse state preparation.

Method: Two-step approach: first prepare dense state on log(s)-qubit sub-register, then map via isometry. Key innovation is efficient algorithm for finding/implementing the isometry circuit as a batched version of Malvetti et al.'s approach. Joint optimization of dense-state preparation and isometry steps, especially for real-coefficient states.

Result: Worst-case Toffoli cost ~2s for large n, providing ~log(s)/2 improvement over state-of-the-art. Numerical benchmarks show cost closer to s. Joint optimization further reduces costs for real-coefficient states.

Conclusion: The approach significantly reduces Toffoli gate requirements for sparse quantum state preparation through optimized isometry implementation and joint step optimization, offering practical improvements for quantum algorithms requiring sparse states.

Abstract: The preparation of quantum states is one of the most fundamental tasks in quantum computing, and a key primitive in many quantum algorithms. Of particular interest to areas such as quantum simulation and linear-system solvers are sparse quantum states, which contain only a small number $s$ of non-zero computational basis states compared to a generic state. In this work, we present an approach that prepares $s$-sparse states on $n$ qubits, reducing the number of Toffoli gates required compared to prior art. We work in the established framework of first preparing a dense state on a $\lceil{\log(s)}\rceil$-qubit sub-register, and then mapping this state to the target state via an isometry, with the latter step dominating the cost of the full algorithm. The speed-up is achieved by designing an efficient algorithm for finding and implementing the isometry. The worst-case Toffoli cost of our isometry circuit, which may be viewed as a batched version of an approach by Malvetti et al., is essentially $2s$ for sufficiently large values of $n$, yielding roughly a $\log(s)/2$ improvement factor over the state-of-the-art. In numerical benchmarks on randomly chosen states, the cost is closer to $s$. With the improved isometry circuit, we examine the dense-state preparation step and present ways to optimize the joint cost of both steps, particularly in the case of target states with purely real coefficients, by outsourcing some sub-tasks from the dense-state preparation to the isometry.

### [31] [Overcoming the No-Go Theorem Yields a Rich Dissipative Phase Diagram in the Open Quantum Rabi Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09414)
*Jun-Ling Wang,Qing-Hu Chen*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The A² term in the anisotropic open quantum Rabi model overcomes the no-go theorem for dissipative phase transitions, creating a rich phase diagram with normal, superradiant, and bistable phases intersecting at tricritical points.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study the open quantum Rabi model with the explicit A² term required by the Thomas-Reich-Kuhn sum rule, and investigate how anisotropy provides a mechanism for overcoming the no-go theorem in dissipative quantum systems to enable observation of dissipative phase transitions.

Method: Analysis of the anisotropic open quantum Rabi model incorporating the A² term, studying the resulting steady-state phase diagram and critical phenomena through theoretical modeling of light-matter interactions in dissipative quantum systems.

Result: The A² term yields a significantly richer and asymmetric steady-state phase diagram with normal, superradiant, and bistable phases intersecting at tricritical points. Isolated bistable phases emerge and the number of tricritical points is reduced. The A² term fundamentally alters photon-number fluctuation scaling near the intersection of critical-line branches enclosing superradiant phases.

Conclusion: Anisotropy provides a generic and robust mechanism for overcoming the no-go theorem in dissipative quantum systems, establishing a genuine platform for observing dissipative phase transitions. The findings open a realistic route toward experimental investigation and dynamical control of nonequilibrium critical phenomena in practical open quantum platforms.

Abstract: The open quantum Rabi model is studied in this work, with the explicit $\mathbf{A}^{2}$ term incorporated as required by the Thomas-Reich-Kuhn sum rule. It is shown that anisotropy provides a generic and robust mechanism for overcoming the no-go theorem in dissipative quantum systems, thereby establishing a genuine platform for observing dissipative phase transitions. The inclusion of the $\mathbf{A}^{2}$ term yields a significantly richer and asymmetric steady-state phase diagram, consisting of normal, superradiant, and bistable phases that intersect at tricritical points, while isolated bistable phases also emerge and the number of tricritical points is reduced. Notably, it is near the intersection of the two critical-line branches enclosing the superradiant phases, rather than at the tricritical points, that the $\mathbf{A}^{2}$ term fundamentally alters the scaling of photon-number fluctuations. Given the inherent role of the $\mathbf{A}^{2}$ term in light-matter interactions, our findings open a realistic route toward the experimental investigation and dynamical control of nonequilibrium critical phenomena in practical open quantum platforms.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Heralding non-Gaussian mechanical states via Geiger photodetection in cavity optomechanics, with analysis of pulsed and continuous-wave schemes for Wigner negativity generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Non-Gaussian mechanical states are essential for quantum-enhanced sensing and tests of macroscopic quantum physics, but generating them remains challenging. The paper aims to develop heralding protocols to create delocalized, nonclassical mechanical states.

Method: Measurement-based protocol using Geiger photodetection of optical output in cavity optomechanics. Two schemes are developed: 1) blue-detuned pulsed scheme, and 2) continuous-wave steady-state scheme with temporal-mode filtering. Analysis focuses on Stokes-induced optomechanical entanglement leading to mechanical Wigner function negativity upon detection.

Result: The protocol identifies conditions under which Stokes-induced optomechanical entanglement produces mechanical Wigner function negativity. Both pulsed and continuous-wave schemes are compared, with quantification of heralding rates and robustness to finite temperature under realistic detection efficiencies.

Conclusion: The proposed measurement-based heralding protocol enables generation of non-Gaussian mechanical states with Wigner negativity, offering practical pathways for quantum-enhanced sensing and tests of macroscopic quantum physics in realistic experimental conditions.

Abstract: Non-Gaussian mechanical states are a key resource for quantum-enhanced sensing and tests of macroscopic quantum physics. We propose a measurement-based protocol to herald delocalized, nonclassical states of a mechanical oscillator in cavity optomechanics by conditioning on Geiger photodetection of the optical output. We analyse under which conditions Stokes-induced optomechanical entanglement give rise to mechanical Wigner Function negativity upon detection. We develop and compare a blue-detuned pulsed scheme and a continuous-wave steady-state scheme employing temporal-mode filtering, and we quantify heralding rates and robustness to finite temperature under realistic detection efficiencies.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Spectral purity of squeezed light in parametric down-conversion shows different gain-dependent behaviors in unapodized vs. apodized dispersion-engineered waveguides, with purification occurring when pump group velocity lies between signal and idler velocities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how dispersion engineering and parametric gain jointly affect the spectral-mode structure of squeezed-light sources, enabling optimization for quantum applications.

Method: Investigated spectral properties of squeezed light generated via parametric down-conversion in high-gain regime using both unapodized and apodized dispersion-engineered waveguides, combining Schmidt-mode analysis with group-velocity-based interpretation.

Result: Unapodized configuration shows monotonic increase in spectral purity with gain, while apodized configuration exhibits nonmonotonic dependence (decreasing then recovering). Rapid purification occurs when pump group velocity lies between signal and idler velocities.

Conclusion: Evolution of spectral purity is governed primarily by waveguide dispersion, demonstrating that dispersion engineering and parametric gain can be jointly exploited to tailor spectral-mode structure of squeezed-light sources for quantum applications.

Abstract: We investigated the spectral properties of squeezed light generated via parametric down-conversion in the high-gain regime, considering both unapodized and apodized dispersion-engineered waveguides. The gain-dependent evolution of these states is examined starting from the low-gain regime, which includes both highly correlated and nearly uncorrelated cases. For the unapodized configuration, we observe a monotonic increase in spectral purity with gain, whereas the apodized configuration exhibits a nonmonotonic dependence, initially decreasing and then recovering at higher gain. By combining Schmidt-mode analysis with a group-velocity-based interpretation, we explain why different dispersion conditions exhibit distinct gain-dependent behavior, specifically that rapid purification occurs when the pump group velocity lies between those of the signal and idler. Our study shows that the evolution of spectral purity is governed primarily by the underlying dispersion of the waveguide. These results demonstrate that dispersion engineering and parametric gain can be jointly exploited to tailor the spectral-mode structure of squeezed-light sources, enabling their optimization for a broad range of quantum applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Develop an analytically tractable theory for reservoir-engineered refrigeration of superconducting microwave cavities using solid-state implementations, specifically to enable targeted cooling below bath temperatures for cryogenic circuit-QED architectures.

Method: Treats double-quantum-dot (DQD) spin qubits not as spectroscopic elements but as tunable engineered reservoirs, using gate control of populations, coherences, linewidths, and detuning to define effective photon birth-death processes with predictable detailed balance.

Result: Derives closed-form expressions for cavity steady state, identifies cooling bounds and detuning-dependent refrigeration valleys, shows refrigeration can drive cavity below both bath temperature and DQD setpoint, distinguishes refreshed and persistent reservoir regimes, and demonstrates collective bright-mode coupling in two-dot configuration enhances refrigeration.

Conclusion: The analytical framework provides predictable control over cavity cooling, identifies constraints from memory effects, saturation, and dark-state formation, and shows potential for targeted millikelvin cooling relevant for cryogenic circuit-QED applications, as confirmed by numerical Lindblad simulations.

Abstract: We present an analytically tractable theory of reservoir-engineered refrigeration of a superconducting microwave cavity and map it onto a realistic solid-state implementation based on gate-defined double-quantum-dot (DQD) spin qubits. Treating the DQD not as a spectroscopic element but as a tunable engineered reservoir, we show how gate control of populations, coherences, linewidths, and detuning defines an effective photon birth-death process with predictable detailed balance. This framework yields closed-form expressions for the cavity steady state, identifies cooling bounds and detuning-dependent refrigeration valleys, and clarifies when refrigeration can drive the cavity below both the bath temperature and the DQD setpoint. By distinguishing refreshed (collision-like) and persistent reservoir regimes, we show how memory effects, saturation, and dark-state formation constrain cooling in realistic devices, while collective bright-mode coupling in a two-dot configuration can enhance refrigeration subject to mismatch and dephasing, as confirmed by numerical Lindblad simulations demonstrating targeted millikelvin cavity cooling relevant for cryogenic circuit-QED architectures.

TL;DR: GMRE is a computable genuine multipartite entanglement measure based on PPT-preserving operations, bounding GHZ-distillable entanglement and generalizable to Renyi entropies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a computable measure of genuine multipartite entanglement that extends the bipartite Rains relative entropy framework to multipartite systems, enabling quantitative analysis of entanglement distillation capabilities.

Method: Introduce genuine multipartite Rains entanglement (GMRE) defined via semi-definite programming, prove monotonicity under selective PPT-preserving quantum operations, and generalize to quantum Renyi relative entropies.

Result: GMRE is a genuine multipartite entanglement monotone that bounds both one-shot standard and probabilistic approximate GHZ-distillable entanglement from above, with computable SDP formulations.

Conclusion: GMRE provides a practical, computable measure for genuine multipartite entanglement with operational significance for bounding distillation rates, extending the Rains framework to multipartite quantum information theory.

Abstract: We introduce the genuine multipartite Rains entanglement (GMRE) as a measure of genuine multipartite entanglement that can be computed using semi-definite programming. Similar to the Rains relative entropy (its bipartite counterpart), the GMRE is monotone under selective quantum operations that completely preserve the positivity of the partial transpose, implying that it is a multipartite entanglement monotone. As a consequence, we show that the GMRE bounds both the one-shot standard and probabilistic approximate GHZ-distillable entanglement from above. We also develop a generalization of this quantity that incorporates other entropies, including quantum Renyi relative entropies.

TL;DR: Dissipative generation of cluster states in spin systems via engineered Markovian dynamics using Lindblad master equation and projection-based dissipative channels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Highly multipartite entangled states like cluster states are important for quantum computing tasks, and dissipative generation provides a physically realizable path for steady-state entanglement in spin systems.

Method: Engineered Markovian dynamics in spin systems coupled via Ising interactions using Lindblad master equation; designed projection-based dissipative channel that drives system toward unique pure steady state corresponding to cluster state by removing orthogonal state contributions; explicit construction of Liouvillian superoperator in full 2^N-dimensional Hilbert space.

Result: Cluster state emerges as steady state when engineered Liouvillian dissipation dominates over local Ising interaction; fidelity and Liouvillian spectral gap relatively insensitive to system size once saturation dissipation achieved (scales linearly with qubit number); computed steady-state density matrix, Liouvillian spectral gap, entanglement witness, and fidelity with respect to ideal cluster state.

Conclusion: Demonstrates physically realizable path toward steady-state entanglement generation in spin systems using engineered dissipation, with cluster state as unique pure steady state under appropriate dissipation conditions.

Abstract: Highly multipartite entangled states play an important role in various quantum computing tasks. We investigate the dissipative generation of a complex entanglement structure as in a cluster state through engineered Markovian dynamics in the spin systems coupled via Ising interactions. Using the Lindblad master equation, we design a projection based dissipative channel that drives the system toward a unique pure steady state corresponding to the desired cluster state. This is done by removing the contribution of the orthogonal states. By explicitly constructing the Liouvillian superoperator in the full $2^N$-dimensional Hilbert space, we compute the steady-state density matrix, the Liouvillian spectral gap, entanglement witness and the fidelity with respect to the ideal cluster state. The results demonstrate that the cluster state emerges as the steady state when the engineered Liouvillian dissipation dominates over the local Ising interaction between spins. Moreover, we find that the fidelity and Liouvillian spectral gap is relatively insensitive to the system size once the saturation dissipation has been achieved that scales linearly with the qubit number. This analysis illustrates a physically realizable path towards steady-state entanglement generation in the spin systems using engineered dissipation.

Motivation: Molecular spins show promise for quantum information science but suffer from electronic spin decoherence caused by interactions with nuclear spins at low temperatures. Predicting dephasing dynamics is challenging due to spin bath complexity, hindering practical applications.

Method: Developed a non-Markovian time-convolutionless master equation to treat an electronic spin coupled to a nuclear-spin bath. The framework relates ab initio electronic structure parameters directly to decoherence dynamics, accounting for pure dephasing in the low-temperature limit.

Result: Applied the method to a series of molecular qubit candidates and demonstrated good agreement with experimental relaxation trends. The approach provides a computationally efficient path for predicting low-temperature decoherence trends.

Conclusion: The developed framework successfully bridges ab initio electronic structure calculations with decoherence dynamics, offering an efficient computational method to predict and understand low-temperature spin decoherence in molecular quantum systems.

Abstract: Molecular spins are promising candidates for quantum information science, leveraging coherent electronic spin states for quantum sensing and computation. However, the practical application of these systems is hindered by electronic spin decoherence, driven by interactions with nuclear spins in the molecule and the surrounding environment at low temperatures. Predicting dephasing dynamics remains a formidable challenge due to the complexity of the spin bath. In this work, we develop a non-Markovian time-convolutionless master equation to treat an electronic spin coupled to a nuclear-spin bath. By relating ab initio electronic structure parameters directly to the decoherence dynamics, we provide a framework that accounts for pure dephasing in the low-temperature limit. We apply this method to a series of molecular qubit candidates and demonstrate good agreement with experimental relaxation trends. This approach offers a computationally efficient path for the prediction of low-temperature decoherence trends in molecular spin systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Non-Gaussian quantum states are essential for universal continuous-variable quantum information processing, particularly for fault-tolerant quantum computing architectures. Large-amplitude squeezed cat states represent a critical resource for temporal breeding protocols and optical GKP state generation.

Method: Protocol involves controlled mixing of Fock states |1⟩ and |2⟩ through a tunable beam splitter, followed by heralding via homodyne detection. This approach generates squeezed coherent-state superpositions (squeezed cat states) on free-space optical pulses.

Result: Achieved record amplitude of α=2.47 for squeezed cat states, exceeding all previously reported values. The generated state displays three well-resolved negative regions in its Wigner function and achieves fidelity of 0.53 with target state ∝ Ŝ(z)(|α⟩ - |-α⟩), with α=2.47 and squeezing parameter z=0.56.

Conclusion: This work represents a significant milestone for temporal breeding protocols and iterative generation of optical GKP states, opening new perspectives for scalable and fault-tolerant photonic quantum architectures.

Abstract: The generation of non-Gaussian quantum states is a key requirement for universal continuous-variable quantum information processing. We report the experimental generation of large-amplitude squeezed coherent-state superpositions (squeezed cat states) on free-space optical pulses, reaching an amplitude of $α= 2.47$, which, to our knowledge, exceeds all previously reported values. Our protocol relies on the controlled mixing of the Fock states $|1\rangle$ and $|2\rangle$ through a tunable beam splitter, followed by heralding via homodyne detection. The resulting state displays three well-resolved negative regions in its Wigner function and achieves a fidelity of $0.53$ with the target state $\propto \hat{S}(z)(|α\rangle - |-α\rangle)$, with $α= 2.47$ and squeezing parameter $z = 0.56$. These results constitute a significant milestone for temporal breeding protocols and for the iterative generation of optical GKP states, opening new perspectives for scalable and fault-tolerant photonic quantum architectures.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a category theory framework for quantum graphs motivated by noncommutative geometry, enabling the study of quantum graph homomorphisms and their connections to quantum strategies in graph homomorphism games.

Method: Introduces category 𝖖𝖌𝖕𝖍 of quantum graphs defined via noncommutative geometry. Constructs closed symmetric monoidal structure with homomorphism quantum graphs [G,H]. Proves equivalence between nonemptiness of [G,H] and existence of winning quantum strategies in (G,H)-homomorphism games. Analyzes properties of finite quantum graphs and morphisms, showing Weaver's CP morphism notions coincide and establishing quantum channel connections.

Result: 𝖖𝖌𝖕𝖍 forms a closed symmetric monoidal category. For finite graphs G and H, quantum graph [G,H] is nonempty iff (G,H)-homomorphism game has winning quantum strategy. Finite quantum graphs are tracial, real, self-adjoint. Weaver's CP morphism notions coincide in this context. Every finite reflexive quantum graph is confusability quantum graph of a quantum channel (answering Daws' question).

Conclusion: The paper establishes a robust category-theoretic framework for quantum graphs with connections to quantum information theory, providing tools to study quantum graph homomorphisms and their relationship to quantum strategies, while resolving foundational questions about CP morphisms and quantum channel representations.

Abstract: We introduce a category $\mathsf{qGph}$ of quantum graphs, whose definition is motivated entirely from noncommutative geometry. For all quantum graphs $G$ and $H$ in $\mathsf{qGph}$, we then construct a quantum graph $[G,H]$ of homomorphisms from $G$ to $H$, making $\mathsf{qGph}$ a closed symmetric monoidal category. We prove that for all finite graphs $G$ and $H$, the quantum graph $[G,H]$ is nonempty iff the $(G,H)$-homomorphism game has a winning quantum strategy, directly generalizing the classical case.
  The finite quantum graphs in $\mathsf{qGph}$ are tracial, real, and self-adjoint, and the morphisms between them are CP morphisms that are adjoint to a unital $*$-homomorphism. We show that Weaver's two notions of a CP morphism coincide in this context. We also show that every finite reflexive quantum graph is the confusability quantum graph of a quantum channel, answering a question of Daws.

TL;DR: The Boson peak in amorphous solids originates from collective contributions of nearly all particles, challenging previous theories that attributed it to minority quasi-localized modes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve the long-standing debate about the origin of the Boson peak in amorphous solids, specifically whether it arises from minority quasi-localized modes or has a more collective origin.

Method: Dispersed the total vibrational density of states (DOS) onto each degree of freedom (DOF) to analyze individual contributions to the Boson peak.

Result: 99.9% of DOFs (and thus nearly all particles) contribute to the Boson peak, demonstrating its collective rather than localized origin.

Conclusion: The Boson peak has a global, collective origin involving almost all particles, challenging the prevailing view that it originates from minority quasi-localized vibrational modes.

Abstract: The origin of the excess vibrational density of states (DOS) beyond Debye's theory in amorphous solids (often referred to as the Boson peak) has been attributed to the presence of quasi-localized vibrational modes in recent years. However, by dispersing the total DOS onto each degree of freedom (DOF), the results of this report provide evidence that \(99.9\%\) of DOFs, and hence almost all particles, contribute to the Boson peak (BP). These results challenge the prevailing opinion that BP is contributed by a minority of particles and highlight its long-neglected global and collective origin.

Result: Demonstrates that non-Hermitian R-transforms originate from single scalar function of two variables, providing new transparent computational method beyond restricted cases like bi-invariant, Hermitian, or elliptic ensembles.

Conclusion: Establishes unified framework connecting non-Hermitian random matrix R-transforms to spherical integrals, offering simplified computational approach for previously restricted cases.

Abstract: In this paper, we establish a connection between the formalism of $\mathcal{R}$-transforms for non-Hermitian random matrices and the framework of spherical integrals, using the replica method. This connection was previously proved in the Hermitian setting and in the case of bi-invariant random matrices. We show that the $\mathcal{R}$-transforms used in the non-Hermitian context in fact originate from a single scalar function of two variables. This provides a new and transparent way to compute $\mathcal{R}$-transforms, which until now had been known only in restricted cases such as bi-invariant, Hermitian, or elliptic ensembles.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically review and compare various approaches to introducing disorder in MBL systems, as MBL represents a key example of ergodicity breaking in interacting many-body systems.

Method: Literature review and analysis of different disorder implementations: (1) random and quasiperiodic diagonal (on-site) disorder, (2) bond disorder in systems with randomly distributed atoms interacting via long-range interactions, and (3) the quantum sun model as an idealized artificial MBL system.

Result: The paper provides a comprehensive review of disorder mechanisms in MBL, highlighting that different disorder types (diagonal vs. bond disorder, random vs. quasiperiodic) can lead to MBL phenomena, with the quantum sun model serving as a particularly clean theoretical example.

Conclusion: MBL is robust across various disorder implementations, with different disorder types offering complementary insights into ergodicity breaking mechanisms in interacting many-body systems.

Abstract: Many-body localization (MBL) appears to be a robust example of ergodicity breaking in many-body interacting systems. Here, we review different aspects of MBL, concentrating on various ways the disorder may be introduced into the system studied. In particular, we consider both the random and quasiperiodic diagonal (i.e., on-site) disorder as well as bond disorder as realized in randomly distributed atoms interacting via long-range interactions. We also review the quantum sun model, which seems to be the ideal, albeit artificial, model exhibiting MBL.
